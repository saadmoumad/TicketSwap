You have to write something in the language that the language was designed for in order to be able to tell if it works. For example, if you're writing an auxiliary language, you might want to see if you can express the Babel text or the Declaration of Human Rights (two popular texts for translation) to see if your language expresses them the way you intended. If you're writing a language for a fictional race, you could translate whatever kind of text that race produces.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No language actually *requires* a genitive case or a construct state (prepositions are an easy way to get out of either; but a constructed language can never be &quot;wrong&quot; even if it's very ambiguous, as long as the final product suits what you were trying to make). You probably would have decided sometime in the design process the most basic questions, like if the language uses cases. If for some reason you haven't, you will notice that this is missing when trying to write something in the language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason this works is that it's impossible to write sentences without deciding on the essential features of the language. Writing sentences forces you to decide on word order, for example. Using sentences with diverse syntax and morphology can also help to determine if you left something out of the language."

If there is something in the original text you have trouble translating, try to find a way to work around it with the grammar you currently have OR invent a new construction to deal with it. In order to do the first one well you need a good awareness of your conlang's grammar. Another danger of this method is relexing the original, especially new vocabulary. Third option: Don't have your conlang be able to translate the challenging characteristic/expression of the text you're translating 'genuinely'. F.e. there's alienable vs. inalienable possession in the text you can simply translate it with the standard expression for possession in your conlang (assuming you do ***not*** have the distinction in your conlang).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You asked about lists.

Like the other aspects, whether this is truly a facet that favors female communication over male based on empirical evidence is unclear to me, but it certainly satisfies many widely accepted assumptions about differences in male and female thought.  However, it should be noted that many of these assumptions are widely challenged today.

The signs themselves are often consciously created (though just as often not), but the grammar around them is mostly generated spontaneously as the language is used more and more - rules begin to coalesce as people need to use their language in more and more circumstances. No one sat down and decided that in ASL, for example, you could set up a location as a pronominal referent and direct future signs toward that location as a way of referring to that pronoun. It simply happened - someone started doing it, what they were doing was sufficiently clear to get across, and then it was grammar. In a conlang, that grammar would have been the result of a conscious choice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, spoken languages could have a very similar history. There's nothing that sets signed languages apart from spoken ones in this regard except their newness - we've watched sign languages come into being out of nothing, while all spoken languages are derived from some ancestor that's been lost in the depths of time.

Consider the following two examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The grammar of **Esperanto** and a large chunk of its vocabulary was created, codified and written down by [L. L. Zamenhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof). People who were interested learned his language according to his rules and later passed it on to their children, creating the first native speakers of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The development of **Tok Pisin** is described as follows: Contact between English speakers and locals of Papua New Guinea gave rise to a pidgin, an incomplete and bare-bones not-quite-language that was just good enough to communicate - everyone would have spoken it a bit differently at that point in time. It became used more commonly and was passed down as a native language to children, creating a full-fledged language. At no point however did its speakers sit down and decide on what grammar Tok Pisin ought to have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now compare these with the case of the **Nicaraguan Sign Langauge**, the currently only natural langauge which we have actively seen develop. Deaf children of Nicaragua previously communicated with the people closest to them with improvised home signs and gestures (in other words they had at best something akin to a pidgin). When they were brought together in a new school for the deaf, they had the need to communicate with each other. The school encouraged use of mouthing or fingerspelling Spanish, but the students, who were not native speakers of Spanish failed at learning these skills. Instead, they started communicating by using their own home signs, forming a pidgin that developed over the following years and was taught to younger students who later arrived. Over time, the language developed complexities similar to what you would find in other signed languages - evidence that it had developed beyond the initial pidgin stage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is clear that the example of Nicaraguan Sign Language is much more similar to that of Tok Pisin than that of Esperanto."

The traditional ones, however, as set out by Joseph Greenberg, were more about syntax and only a little about morphology, which roots would probably fall under depending on what you want to do with them. Still, we can use the same techniques. We can look at what some real languages do with roots and try to figure out what they don't do, and then do that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Roots in most languages are pretty static. They have to be, because they carry the majority of semantic content for a word, so they have to remain recognizable. Some languages, though, have morphology that alters what we would think of as the root in Western languages. In many Semitic languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, roots are combinations of consonants, usually three but sometimes two, and inflect by changing the vowels. In Arabic the consonants _k-t-b_ are a root that has to do with books and writing. The singular word &quot;book&quot; is _kitāb_, the plural &quot;books&quot; is _kutub_, &quot;booklet&quot; is _kutayyib_ with a suffix, &quot;writer&quot; is _kātib_, and the verb &quot;to write&quot; is _kataba_. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some languages also have infixes, which are affixes that are added inside the root instead of being added to the beginning (prefix) or end (suffix). Tagalog, for example: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For example, the verb takbo (meaning to run) + the infix um can be made into the word tumakbo, which equates to the simple past tense past tense ran.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(From http://talktagalog.com/tagalog-verbs-grammar-prefixes-infixes-suffixes/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the Arabic example, some of the morphology was inflectional, meaning it added some extra meaning to the original root--making a plural, for instance. Some was derivational, meaning we added something to the root that created a new root word--making &quot;books&quot; from &quot;book&quot; is inflectional, but making &quot;book&quot;,  &quot;writer&quot;, and &quot;to write&quot; from the root _k-t-b_ is derivational. So one possible meaning for &quot;root system&quot; is a system of derivational morphology, and a &quot;unique agglutinative root system&quot; would be a unique agglutinative system of derivational morphology. Speakers tend to regularize morphology over time, but derivational morphology is a little more resistant to it than inflectional: in English, nobody uses &quot;whom&quot; anymore, but we still preserve irregularities like &quot;_in_-vincible&quot; vs. &quot;_un_-beatable&quot; vs. &quot;_a_-sexual&quot;. So with derivational morphology, you have a bit more freedom to concoct a weird, wild system without having to simulate a bunch of lazy peasant speakers who can't be bothered to keep using your fancy inflections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, hopefully this gives you some ideas for how to create your own system."

Having pronouns agree with the noun class of the nouns talked about greatly helps reduce ambiguity, though it would likely not help in your specific example with two male human participants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Obviation** is the system of having two distinct third person pronouns, one (the _proximal_) referring to the most salient (important, topical) referent and one (the _obviative_) to less salient ones. In your example, likely Adam would be the proximal, and James the obviative. There are nice examples on the relevant [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obviative#Examples).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third option, which is to my knowledge only attested in signed languages is **Indexing**. This is basically the human language equivalent of variables in programming languages: a new variable, usually a location in the sign space, is assigned to every important referent, and referred to by pointing at the location or otherwise involving the location during signing of relevant words.

For example linking verbs like is or looks will not be assigned gender because they are used to link the subject to the action verb or to adjectives and adverbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pronouns practically already have gender in them. For example &quot;he&quot; is masculine. However &quot;he&quot; could also be neuter, at least in English because it can be used to refer to someone of unknown gender. &quot;it&quot; is clearly neuter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It does make sense though for all nouns and adjectives to have gender. And again, there are clear examples of where 1 gender makes far more sense. An example of that is the adjective &quot;pregnant&quot; It makes far more sense to say &quot;pregnant&quot; is feminine because male pregnancy, while possible, is extremely rare. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But as for the assigning of gender I figured it would be like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Feminine Masculine Neuter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Latin had this 3 gender system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now I am not so sure I would want inflections from grammatical case. I mean word order is a much simpler way to get across the same ideas as grammatical case. In other words for example instead of having the genitive case you could just use a possession marker on the possessor and either way, you get the same thing across, possession. But the possession marker is way simpler than inflecting every possessable noun for the genitive case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I was wondering, should adjectives agree with the noun in all aspects including gender or would a conlang where adjectives have inherent gender and don't have to agree with the noun when it comes to gender be just fine?"

While derivational and inflectional morphology could be done away with (and its information load transferred to syntax I guess), the question is how many semantic morphemes is too few before a language becomes incomprehensibly vague. I'm guessing the theoretical lowest lower limit is the set of Goddard's (*Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analysis, 2010*) set of 63 semantic primes. Goddard and Wierzbicka propose that you could theoretically explain almost all necessary concepts by building up from this set of primes, and lacking ways to express some of them will leave you incapable of expressing at least a subset of all possible topics.

I got a list of what is considered basic English—which are the 800 odd words of a basic English vocabulary. Removed the words that were of no use in the context of my world. Came up with words in the Old Tongue in each of those English words and then added those words that did have a specific context in my world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Elsewhere on that page is an interview where he said this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;What language is the Old Tongue based on? Gaelic, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and some additions of my own—bridging material, if you will. Grammar and syntax are a blending of English, German and Chinese, with some influences from a set of African languages, read about long ago and all but the oddities of structure long since forgotten. There are inverted constructions, for example (as in Mordero dagain pas duente cuebiyar!—literally, &quot;Death fear none holds my heart!&quot;) and places where the article is omitted, especially where the word is a title or has gained enough importance to now incorporate the article; the absence of article indicates that it is the important or special meaning of the word that is intended. Though even then, it is not a hard and fast rule; the same inconsistencies of English are incorporated here. I am attempting to create a language which has grown, not one which was made.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to be a complete enough language in terms of grammar and authentic enough for Jordan to use, though lacking in vocabulary.  From these quotes I get the feeling that he created the language well enough at one point that he didn't have to spend hours conlanging to be able to put a few sentences into his novels.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the Wheel of Time Companion there was an English-Old Tongue dictionary, which is uploaded on Tor.com [here](https://www.tor.com/2016/12/20/the-wheel-of-time-english-to-old-tongue-dictionary/).  At the beginning on the website (not sure if this is also in the book as I don't have it on me) this is written:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;While it is reminiscent of Tolkien’s ground-up creation of Elvish languages for The Lord of the Rings, The Old Tongue differs in that Jordan took a top-down approach, creating a dictionary of terms from which some basic suffixes, roots, and usage rules emerged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't bother scrolling all the way down or counting the words, but it doesn't seem to have much grammar aside from the suffixes and stuff.  Although we don't have access to this, Jordan seems to be implying that the grammar does exist.

Wierzbicka and Goddard propose that you could theoretically explain almost all necessary concepts by building up from this set of primes, and lacking ways to express some of them will leave you incapable of expressing at least a subset of all possible topics.

There's also the colloquial sense, though - the way people _think_ about it, when someone says &quot;logical language.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is designed to be a [regular language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language). This gives it a few key properties that make it easier for computers to process (though it's still an immensely complicated task to implement). Most of these properties are mathematical, and you can read them on the Wikipedia page. However, what it means in an intuitive way is that no word or word phrase's meaning changes based on words it's not adjacent to. That's a nice property when you're a computer and have a hard time maintaining a sense of context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lojban also has no irregular forms or rule exceptions whatsoever. All words are constructed based on specific properties that are clearly delineated, using roots that are unique and are intended to mesh with each other as-is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means that any construction which can be built in a logical form can be written *completely* and *uniquely* in Lojban. There are no ambiguities _between_ forms. Note, though, that this is commonly confused with &quot;the language has no ambiguity.&quot; It's possible to be ambiguous in Lojban, but only intentionally, and that ambiguity is unique to the way you wrote it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also allows for systematic, structured learning and use. New words fit into the existing grammar and structure without any other prompting, once you know what they mean and how they're used. No additional grammatical structures are needed to use any words, once you know them. &#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Languages like German go a step further and would just use *this* instead of *the latter* in most cases. These words do not replace pronouns, they just complement them.

For example linking verbs like is or looks will not be assigned gender because they are used to link the subject to the action verb or to adjectives and adverbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pronouns practically already have gender in them. For example &quot;he&quot; is masculine. However &quot;he&quot; could also be neuter, at least in English because it can be used to refer to someone of unknown gender. &quot;it&quot; is clearly neuter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It does make sense though for all nouns and adjectives to have gender.

I mean word order is a much simpler way to get across the same ideas as grammatical case. In other words for example instead of having the genitive case you could just use a possession marker on the possessor and either way, you get the same thing across, possession. But the possession marker is way simpler than inflecting every possessable noun for the genitive case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I was wondering, should adjectives agree with the noun in all aspects including gender or would a conlang where adjectives have inherent gender and don't have to agree with the noun when it comes to gender be just fine?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** I don't want to use the concepts in English except maybe the pronouns, I am just using it as an example language for those concepts partly because that is the only language I know to fluency."

Likewise, &quot;Quch&quot; is the verb for &quot;to be happy&quot;. Using &quot;jIbel&quot; or &quot;jiQuch&quot; to indicate satisfaction upon meeting someone is a possibility.&#xD;&#xA; - **&quot;maj&quot;** (&quot;Good&quot;) or **&quot;majQa'&quot;** (&quot;Well done&quot;) are exclamations used as praise. You could use these - preferably &quot;majQa'&quot; - when welcoming an inferior who has successfully completed a task, like blowing up an enemy spaceship.&#xD;&#xA; - **&quot;toH&quot;** is another exclamation, meaning &quot;Well!&quot; or &quot;So!&quot; You would use this in, for instance, a sentence like&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Well! I didn't expect to see you back alive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1 Appending &quot;Daq&quot;, to make &quot;nuqDaq&quot;, yields &quot;Where?&quot;&lt;/sup&gt;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Japanese phonology fits these systems *very* well because syllables are basically (C(y))V with the principal exception of syllabic *n* and the secondary one of ‘double consonants’ (まって — matte). Therefore, Japanese needs only around 50 distinct symbols for its syllabary. It made perfect sense to simplify complex Chinese characters to a reduced form carrying just a phonetic information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, languages such as German or English would be terrible choices for inventing a syllabary. Their syllable structures have very little constraints at all; basically anything is possible. Coming up with a syllabary would require many hundreds if not thousands of characters — to the point where it would be simpler and more consistent to create an ideographic writing system instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take for example *to write*. In a syllabary, the symbol for *write* in *I write* would be the same as in *right (there)* or *you are right.* But then if you take *I wrote*, the *wrote* would be something completely different (yet with the same symbol as *rote memorisation,* I think?). *I have written* would use two symbols, neither of which has anything to do with the previous ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an alphabetic or alphasyllabic system, there would at least be some visual resemblence between all those forms allowing for recognition. That’s also why English benefits from its extremely irregular (based on phonetics) spelling: meanings can be recognised based on writing and words with similar meanings are written similarly. Their common root is retained in a common spelling which is not possible in a pure syllabary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A language’s writing system will either have been developed by the language itself or have been copied and adapted from geographically close languages. Of course, it would be possible for a Germanic-type language with a highly variable syllable structure to adapt a syllabic writing system initially — but it is very highly likely that it will soon be improved in numerous ways until an actually working alternative has been found.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of thinking how you can bring the two ends together, I would propose you think of which writing system actually makes sense for your language."

In fact, it is likely that Linear A was used to write the pre-Greek language of Crete, and the incoming Greeks adopted this writing system for their own use, but without changing how the system fundamentally works. In doing so, they developed &quot;spelling conventions&quot; to represent sound patterns found in Greek but not in the syllabary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; First, there are many Greek sounds that are missing in Linear B signs, such as [g], [kh], [gw], [b], [ph], [th], and [l]. To solve this problem, signs for similar sounds are used instead: p-signs are used for [p], [b], and [ph]; k-signs are used for [k], [g], and [kh]; t-signs are used for [t] and [th]; q-signs are used for [kw] and [gw]; and r-signs are used for [r] and [l]. However, while this convention was likely easily understood by ancient Mycenaean scribes, it took modern scholars a lot of theoretical analysis and work, plus comparison with later Greek dialects and reconstructed Mycenaean words to rediscover how this system works&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And more relevantly:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Another inadequacy stems from the fact that Linear B signs usually represent Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllables, but the syllabic structure of Greek allows initial consonant clusters, ending consonants, and dipthongs. In the case of a syllable with a initial consonant cluster, individual consonants in the cluster are written by a CV sign whose vowel matches the vowel of the syllable. Therefore, for example, the word tri is written as ti-ri, and khrusos as ku-ru-so. In the case of ending consonant, the situation becomes more complicated. Ending consonants such as [l], [m], [n], [r], and [s] are not usually written, whereas other consonants such as [k] and [p] are written in a way similar to initial consonants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So one way to represent consonant clusters in a syllabary is to pick a &quot;dummy vowel&quot; that gets read over when the word is pronounced, as in Linear B, or Japanese katakana when writing foreign words. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question doesn't mention just how complex the syllable structure is; if it's not _too_ complex, you can also do what Japanese hiragana does with the ん character and have a single character that represents a syllable-ending consonant. Or something like what [Brahmi](http://www.ancientscripts.com/brahmi.html) does for vowels and nasals, adding strokes and dots to represent them. Maybe if _kra_, _tra_, and _pra_ are common syllables in your language, you could have a stroke that represents an _r_ between the consonant and vowel, and add it to the characters for _ka_, _ta_, and _pa_."

The [Lord of the Rings Wikia](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Khuzdul) states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It appears to be structured, like real-world Semitic languages, around the triconsonantal roots: kh-z-d, b-n-d, z-g-l.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, from [folk.uib.no](https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The basic structure of Khuzdul resembles that of Semitic languages, like Arabic and Hebrew. The stems from which words are derived are not by themselves pronounceable words, but consist of consonants only. Nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. are derived not only by prefixes and suffixes (if such devices are used at all), but also by inserting certain vowels between these consonants, sometimes also by doubling one of the consonants. Often the words are actually inflected by internal vowel-changes instead of adding affixes: Rukhs means &quot;Orc&quot;, but plural &quot;Orcs&quot; is Rakhâs. The root consonants - the so-called radicals - remain the same, like *R-Kh-S in this case. In Khuzdul as well as in Semitic languages, there are usually three radicals in the root; several such roots are mentioned in TI:174 and RS:466: B-R-Z &quot;red&quot;, B-N-D &quot;head&quot;, K-B-L &quot;silver&quot;, N-R-G &quot;black&quot;. An example of a biconsonantal root is Z-N &quot;dark, dim&quot; (RS:466).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Baruk Khazâd!** is said to mean &quot;Axes of the Dwarves!&quot; Baruk is usually taken to be an example of something similar to the Hebrew &quot;construct state&quot;: the state a word is said to be in when it is placed in front of a noun to express a genitival relationship: X Y meaning &quot;X of Y&quot; or &quot;Y's X&quot;. (Compare Hebrew sûs &quot;horse&quot;, hammelekh &quot;the king&quot;, sûs hammelekh &quot;the king's horse, the horse of the king&quot;.) Of course, we cannot be certain that baruk is the normal plural &quot;axes&quot; and not a specialized form meaning &quot;axes of&quot;. It may be significant that all the other attested plurals contain a long vowel: Khazâd &quot;Dwarves&quot;, Rakhâs &quot;Orcs&quot;, tarâg &quot;beards&quot;, shathûr &quot;clouds&quot;, ûl &quot;streams&quot;, dûm &quot;excavations, halls&quot;, bizâr &quot;valleys&quot;. Could the normal plural &quot;axes&quot; be *barûk? Shathûr &quot;clouds&quot; may represent a plural pattern in -a-û-. In Hebrew, the vowels of words in the construct state are often shortened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Was it actually based on Hebrew / Semitic languages, or is that simply an impression?"

As such, a purely logographic system cannot really deal with natural languages to their full extent, and therefore pick up &quot;impurities&quot;, not just out of convenience, but out of necessity, since without them they are generally at best mnemonic aids and not a full (or almost full) representation of the spoken language. If you want a pure logographic system to be realistically viable for your conlang, going the oligomorphemic route, like Toki Pona, is probably the most reasonable, as the low number of morphemes reduces the strain of learning a large number of symbols, as well as the issue of coming up with new ones for new or rarely written-about concepts, since morphemes are a closed class, and the necessarily relatively general meaning of these morphemes means that it would likely be relatively straightforward to represent the majority of them with mostly intuitive iconography."

English already has some reflexives, providing some amount of disambiguation, Danish goes a little further has a compulsory reflexive/non-reflexive distinction in 3rd person possessives, and while the specific example you mentioned doesn't work well in translation, a similarly problematic sentence &quot;Adam sent James his essay&quot; can be easily somewhat disambiguated with this system:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; sendte James&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; **sin**&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; stil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; sendte James&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; **hans**&lt;sub&gt;j(/k)&lt;/sub&gt; stil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is possible for reflexive systems to be significantly more broad than this, rather than just referring to antecedents in the same clause, even if it's omitted via some other rule, e.g. in *&quot;Jonh saw Adam and shot **himself** in the foot&quot;*, where there is no overt reference to John in the second clause, because it's been omitted due to subject coreference (such deletion rules, when constraints are put on them is actually another way of reducing ambiguity, I have relatively recently written [a rather long forum post][1] on this which goes into much more detail about them), it's possible to have &quot;**long-distance reflexives**&quot; which take antecedents outside of the clause. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Mandarin, the reflexive _ziji_ can refer to both local and non-local antecedents in some cases:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Zhangsan renwei Lisi kan-bu-qi ziji  &#xD;&#xA;`Zhangsan think Lisi look-not-up REFL`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks Lisi&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; looks down on self&lt;sub&gt;**i/j**&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Certain things block this though, for example shifts in perspective:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Zhangsan renwei wo zhidao Wangwu xihuan ziji  &#xD;&#xA;`Zhangsan think I know Wangwu like REFL`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; know Wangwu&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; likes self&lt;sub&gt;**\*i/\*j/k**&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Igbo, in complements of communication, entities that are coreferential with the source of information are marked by what is known as &quot;**logophoric pronouns**&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;ọ́  sị̀rị̀ nà   ọ́  byàrà  &#xD;&#xA;`he said that he came`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; came&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;ọ́  sị̀rị̀ nà   yá  byàrà  &#xD;&#xA;`he said that LOG came`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; came&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Gokana also has such a system, though the marking is on the verb, though the constraints on what can be coreferential are quite free:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aè kɔ aè dɔ  &#xD;&#xA;`he said he fell`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; fell&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aè kɔ aè dɔ-ɛ  &#xD;&#xA;`he said he fell-LOG`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; fell&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aè kɔ oò div-èè e  &#xD;&#xA;`he said you hit-LOG him`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that you hit him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aè kɔ oò ziv-èè a gĩ́ã́  &#xD;&#xA;`he said you stole his yams`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that you stole his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; yams&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The wikipedia article on logophoricity][2] goes into more depth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is also possible to have two different reflexives, requiring respectively local and non-local antecedents. Danish has a rather limited case of this in bare complements to perception verbs, where the two reflexives _sig_ and _sig selv_ which are usually either only different in level of emphasis or in complementary distribution, respectively require non-local and local antecedents:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Holger hørte Peter tale om sig.  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Holger hørte Peter tale om sig selv.  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Holger hørte Peter tale om ham.  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**&quot;4th Person systems&quot;** such as seen Eskimo languages are rather similar, though more general as they are used in all subordinate clauses are also another type of reflexive-like construction (the &quot;fourth&quot; person is often labeled 3R) and they are also used intraclausally in possessive marking. In all of these cases they mark that a participant or possessor is coreferential with the subject of the main clause (which is defined in terms of S/A despite the case marking being ergative). An example from [Siberian Yupik][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; esghaghyagu quyaaq  &#xD;&#xA;`see:CNSQ:3s&gt;3s happy:IND.3s`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; esghaghyamigu quyaaq  &#xD;&#xA;`see:CNSQ:3Rs&gt;3s happy:IND.3s`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; esghaghyatni quyaaq  &#xD;&#xA;`see:CNSQ:3s&gt;3Rs happy:IND.3s`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to all these various reflexive constructions, **switch reference**, the overt marking of whether the &quot;subject&quot; is either the same or different, either between two coordinate clauses, or a subordinate and main clause can also resolve some ambiguity. Take for example this pair of sentences from Hua:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ebgi-Ø-na korihie  &#xD;&#xA;`hit-SAME-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ran away&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ebgi-ga-na korihie  &#xD;&#xA;`hit-3sg.DIFF-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; ran away&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Switch reference can only deal with one set of coreference though what exactly is tracked varies. In some languages, it is specifically the actor that is tracked, while others may track the topic or some other pragmatically prominent NP, or may even differ in what is tracked in the controlling clause as opposed to the clause recieving the marking. Additionally the marking may occasionally also be sensitive to changes in things like time, place, discourse coherency and/or reality status, and as a result, switch reference may fulfill may other roles than simply dealing with ambiguity.

Modern computers are good enough approximations for most purposes, but they are in reality just very large finite state machines. A true Turing machine requires *infinite* storage space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The infinite storage space of the Turing machine model is mirrored in the (computationally equivalent) lambda calculus by the capacity to define an infinite number of arbitrarily-named variables. This suggests a natural connection to human languages: the potentially-infinite set of variables in lambda calculus corresponds to the set of *words* in a human language, while human grammars correspond to the reduction rules of lambda calculus. Transferring that back to the Turing machine model, the infinite storage tape of a Turing machine corresponds to the potential vocabulary of a human language, while the state transition rules correspond to a grammar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the first thing you need to make a human language &quot;Turing complete&quot;--capable of referring to or describing *anything* that can be referred to or described--is an infinite vocabulary! That's clearly impossible, but like real computers approximate Turing machines, we can approximate a &quot;Turing complete conlang&quot; simply by ensuring there is some way to create new lexical items--either strictly by as-needed de-novo coinage, or oligosynthesis, or whatever other word-formation techniques you like--and then abstract away from the vocabulary and looking at the *rules* for how that vocabulary is used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Continuing the analogy, the fact that there are two such radically different formulations for computation that are nevertheless provably identical in expressive power (the lambda calculus and Turing machine--and, in fact, even more different formalisms than that, like the SKI combinator calculus, NAND machines and the One Instruction Set Computer, etc.) suggests that there may not be any *single* simplest set of grammar constructs that make an abstract language &quot;complete&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Empirically, however, if you put stock in David Gil's work on so-called IMA (Isolating-Monocategorial-Associative) language, the only necessary *and sufficient* requirement for effective human communication (or as he puts it, enough grammar &quot;to sail a boat&quot;) is the existence of a generic &quot;association operator&quot;--a way to say &quot;the things represented by these two sub-phrases are related somehow&quot;--and literally everything else can be handled by pragmatics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you need the ability to introduce whatever words you find that you need in a given situation, and you need at least one operator that can specify arbitrary relations between things (e.g., the generic English preposition &quot;of&quot;)--which could have a surface expression as simple as juxtaposition. Everything else is sugar, that just makes figuring out the pragmatic details easier." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The possibility of the Voynich manuscript being a constructed language was brought to his attention by [William Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Friedman), an expert on the manuscript. Friedman confided to Tiltman, after decades of work on it, that he thought the writing could be a form of &quot;synthetic universal language&quot;, and so the cryptographer expanded his investigation in that direction, [writing a paper on the theory](https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/tech-journals/assets/files/voynich-manuscript-mysterious.pdf).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The basic premise behind a &quot;synthetic universal language&quot; is to use characters to represent certain logical ideas; by chaining together letters, you can create &quot;words&quot; that describe more complicated principles. By adding the appropriate prefixes and suffixes, characters can be quite powerful. Tiltman noticed that some of the patterns in the words fit this type of design. However, the evidence for this sort of construction was not strong enough, and Tiltman's analysis of the frequency of the occurrence of certain letters did not support Friedman's hypothesis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tiltman also traced the historical origin of a &quot;universal language&quot;, to determine if such an idea had been bounced around early enough. However, this proved difficult, and Tiltman found no concrete examples prior to the mid-17th century. This is two centuries after the Voynich manuscript was written - sometime in the 15th century - and so *if* the manuscript was indeed written in a universal language, it would predate these universal languages by two centuries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tiltman noted&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It was clear that the productions of these two men [Wilkins and Dalgarno, two early proponents of universal languages] were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution. When I was&#xD;&#xA;attempting to trace back the idea of universal language, I came upon a printed book entitled The Universal Character by Cave Beck, London 1657 (also printed in French in the same year). Cave Beck was one of the original members of the British Royal Society and his system was certainly a cumbersome mixture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beck's writing claims that the idea of a universal language goes back to the 16th century, but this still places it many years after the manuscript's origin.  The idea of synthetic universal languages, though perhaps relatively widespread in the 17th century, simply was unknown in the 15th. This was a strike against Friedman's theory. If the Voynich manuscript was a synthetic universal language, it would have borne no relation - in time of conception of structure - to later examples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The universal language route is of course not the only possibility; constructed languages can take many forms. However, it was possible the most promising option, and research into it went nowhere. Friedman's claim remains unsupported, and, to my knowledge, no further academic analyses have been done. We certainly can't rule out the theory that the Voynich manuscript is written in a constructed language, but we have no reason to believe that it is." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In general, it is rather easy to come up with a feature that does not seem to occur in natural languages: simply take a feature every language appears to possess (for example: phonemes, verbs, hierarchical syntax that can be described with syntax trees, a very large amount of words) and reject it. Then see what you can do with the language. This leads to so-called _Engelangs_, short for “Engineered Languages”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively, one can from the ground up decide to build structure from a different “philosophy”, e.g. build on predicate logic, or stacks (the CS concept), or… well, whatever you can think of that can organize information, really. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make an example, there is [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/). Ithkuil does not strive to be a naturalistic language. Instead, its goal is to allow for unambiguity. Among the things it does to provide that are a range of grammatical inflections not found in any natural language - too many to list, but one example I can make is its case system. In most natural languages, case is something of a helper to syntax. Case marks words for their syntactic roles and thus helps create the structure necessary to understand a sentence. In Ithkuil however, case marks _semantics_. The sentence “I hit you” in ithkuil would require different cases for “I” and “you” depending on whether e.g. I was a volitional actor, or whether the hitting was an unavoidable circumstance, or an accident, or mediated by someone else… While traces of such systems are found in natural language, none get even close to the extreme of Ithkuil. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, an interesting anecdote is the _Conlang Trigger System_, a novel way of structuring languages employed in _naturalistic_ conlangs (i.e. ones striving to be mistakable for natural languages). The trigger system developed from misunderstandings of the way certain Austronesian languages (such as Tagalog) work. It’s a perfectly plausible system… just not actually attested in natural languages. I believe there’s a nice writeup on the whole topic, but cannot find it right now.

But never have I seen such a writeup on the opposite phenomenon, which one might call _Tonoexodus_. Obviously, one way for tone to get lost is to simply have tones merge until there’s only one left. However, doing that without any thought to a highly tonal language would be rather disastrous. If any Chinese language suddenly lost all its tones this would likely make communication rather challenging. This makes me think that perhaps, there is more to tonoexodus than just a disappearance of tone.

Yes, a sudden collapse of the tone system in a Chinese language, or any other language with a high functional load on tonal contrasts would be rather challenging to deal with, but so would any sudden collapse of significant scope, whereas a slow collapse, where contrasts are lost slowly, one after one, in some environments before others gives plenty of time to resolve any disasterous mass ambiguity with innovations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have tried looking around for examples of tone loss, and this seems to be the pattern I have been able to find. The Oto-Manguean languages with fewer tonal contrast that the reconstructed protolanguages seem to simply come from mergers of tones, either consistently or only in some environments (e.g. unstressed syllables) though the data is not quite clear[\[1\]][1]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Classical Chinese had 8 tonal categories divisible into _yin_ and _yang_ registers occuring respectively after voiced and unvoiced consonants, and into four different categories, _ping_, _shang_, _qu_ and _ru_(checked syllables). While some modern lects such as Songjiang maintain all of these as seperate categories (Songjiang also retains contrastive onset voicing), others collapse the system in various ways. Beijing Mandarin collapses the _yin/yang_ distinction of the _shang_ and _qu_ tones and merges _ru_ into the other tones, while the relatively nearby Tianjin Mandarin keeps _yin shang_ seperate, while merging _yang shang_ with other tones. Along similar lines the different Chinese lects have radically different distinction-dimininshing sandhi processes, from the well-known relatively limited `214 &gt; 35 / _214` rule of Beijing Mandarin to the complete loss of surface realisation of all but one dominant lexical tone in Northern Wu variants such as Shanghainese. Again, there does not seem to be any phonological compensatory measures associated with any of these losses of contrasts.[\[2\]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tonoexodus that isn't a simple collapse seems to be hard to find, though the Danish glottal suprasegmental feature _stød_ likely originates in a pitch accent system (note that some dialects have pitch-accent and some collapse the distinction entirely), and it seems reasonable to expect that other collapses of a two-way tone system to a phonation system could be found. As for other things, the largely autosegmental nature of tone means that it doesn't leave much room for other segmental changes, however there seem to be a few cases of such influences, primarily on consonant voicing discussed in sections 2.6 and 2.7 of Yip's _Tone_[\[3\]][3] and references therein, though she notes that it has been argued by Thurgood that _all_ such alternations are a product of phonation types (which may then coincidentally be associated with tone) influencing voicing rather than tone itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In conclusion it seems that the most likely process of tonoexodus is simply a slow gradual loss of contrasts in an increasing number of environments, with the associated lexical replacement/innovation that comes with language change, and a tone system evolving into something else rather than just being lost entirely is likely to become a phonation system, possibly with a minor influence on consonant voicing as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www-01.sil.org/acpub/repository/16416.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=15iz7n8460TEoqAjh9uyld33VadySCUY_&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rxWSzQz-V8sJExiDfc3lW6sl3whCXWnV" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If there is something in the original text you have trouble translating, try to find a way to work around it with the grammar you currently have OR invent a new construction to deal with it. In order to do the first one well you need a good awareness of your conlang's grammar. Another danger of this method is relexing the original, especially new vocabulary. Third option: Don't have your conlang be able to translate the challenging characteristic/expression of the text you're translating 'genuinely'. F.e. there's alienable vs. inalienable possession in the text you can simply translate it with the standard expression for possession in your conlang (assuming you do ***not*** have the distinction in your conlang).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You asked about lists. There are questionnaires used for typology which I think can be helpful for conlanging, but I don't know of anyone who has tried utilizing them.

Showing off. I know something cool that you don’t. For some, that is the reason to learn Latin but for others that may be the reason to attempt to learn e.g. a language from the Lord of the Rings. It can easily have a vast impression on fans of the franchise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Cosplay. This is especially true for languages appearing in games/movies/etc. For many cosplayers, the prime goal when cosplaying a character is to mimic them as perfectly as possible. Of course, if you’re mimicking e.g. Eragon after he has learnt the ancient language, you want to at least be able to produce meaningful sentences (unless you’re explicitly aiming for mishaps like the one in the underground city — but arguably that requires even *more* knowledge). If you’re cosplaying Arya, that is even more true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Creating a franchise that uses a conlang. If you want to make extensive use of your conlang while writing a series of books like A Song of Ice and Fire, getting it right at later stages is much easier if you have some basic understanding early.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4.

Since this means that the parser only ever &quot;looks ahead&quot; a maximum distance of one token while parsing, garden path sentences are impossible in the traditional sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This just means that the parse tree can't be drastically transformed during the sentence—it doesn't mean that the *meaning* of sentences can't be changed signficantly later on within them. The first example that comes to mind is the song *NA KU* from Djemynai's [ZA'O](https://djemynai.bandcamp.com/album/zao), which contains the chorus &quot;*pu ku zvati fa do .ije ca ku zvati fa do... na ku*.&quot; This glosses roughly as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    pu-ku zvati   fa-do&#xD;&#xA;    PST   present 2sg.NOM&#xD;&#xA;    You were here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    .i-je ca-ku zvati   fa-do   na-ku&#xD;&#xA;    and   PRES  present 2sg.NOM NEG&#xD;&#xA;    Now you are not here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the use of *ku* allows the negation particle to be moved to the very end of the sentence. This does not affect the parse, so it's not a traditional garden path sentence, but it still allows the creation of a surprising effect, which is similar in some senses."

I am by no means an expert, but this is directly from the mouth of Laáadan's creator.  The following quote contains pertinent excerpts of the article, parts of which I have put in bold:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Another goal I had for Láadan was that **it should be as easy as possible to figure out what a particular word or morpheme means just by looking at it**...I wanted the language to work like a Tinkertoy® set works, so that people could take the pieces and fit them together easily to make larger forms. For example: the Láadan word for “bee” is “zhomid”; that word is made from “zho” — the Láadan word for “sound,” and “mid” — the Láadan word for “creature.” **The meaning is transparent from the word’s parts.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**First, however, I had to construct the most basic elements of the language — the words/ morphemes that are called “roots” and can’t be taken apart into smaller meaningful pieces**. When linguists begin working with a language for which no grammar or dictionary is available, they ordinarily start with a set of roughly 100 very basic words made up of items like “eat” and “sleep” and “food.” I followed that practice, and began by constructing a core vocabulary of those basic words; when I had those done I began adding additional roots that I felt were needed. **Sometimes I can explain to some extent how I chose a particular shape for one of those words; much of the time I can’t.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;For example… I can explain that I chose “oódóo” for “bridge” because when pronounced its tune makes the shape of a humpback bridge. I can explain that I chose “rul” for “cat” because the purring of a cat sounds to me like “rulrulrulrul…” But the choice of “ana” for “food” and “ina” for “sleep” was arbitrary; **I have no explanation for those choices other than that I tried to give them a shape that could easily be combined with other morphemes.** For any constructed language that isn’t based on some existing language, the hardest part will always be putting together the inventory of roots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An [update to the Láadan dictionary](http://www.sfwa.org/members/elgin/LaadanLessons/LaadanVocab0306.html) shows that not all of the words were created by Suzette Haden Elgin (the creator of Láadan) but all that are not roots in and of themselves--roots which seem to have been created rather arbitrarily--can be figured out from these roots.  For example, in the dictionary I linked, the word for beaver is &quot;eduthemid.&quot;  This contains the rood for animal, &quot;mid,&quot; and some other root, I presume &quot;eduth.&quot;  I do't know what this means, but it was constructed in this way so that someone who knew these roots but did not know the word could discern that it means beaver. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The original creator of Láadan made a couple of arbitrary roots that could then become a lexicon through a logical process of morphology, with help from multiple other people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I don't think anybody has ever learned Loglan or Lojban as a native language; you could therefore argue that it was never alive in the first place.

I will try to explain why i started to learn a constructed language called lojban.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**1. Better Meaning extraction for human-computer interaction**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I want to build AI's and talk to them like real humans. The problem i'm facing is how to convert my English **from speech** to - **text form** - **then into meaning** - so that the computer can take different programmatic actions depending on that meaning.. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And i want to do this with complex thoughts - not &quot;Cortana close the light&quot; type of commands. That is easy to do it in English already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;English and most other languages is not well suited for easy parsing of meaning. The amount of ambiguity in any non trivial phrase is enormous. Exponential complexity is a big problem. We humans solve it by putting things into context - and also trough lot's and lot's of experience. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And even so  - we sometimes misunderstand each other.. Keep in mind that we are very smart. Computers are kind of dumb at this point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Building this context and this experience in an AI is almost an inapproachable task. Building the context is even a bigger problem then parsing the relations between words. It's called an AI hard problem. Only big companies like Google and Microsoft have the resources to approach a problem of this size. Cortana is mostly pre-scripted answers at this point (feb 2018). Is not the real deal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now if you have a constructed language like lojban - you have at least 2 big benefits:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. the speech to text conversion happens very easily - because lojban has no phonetic ambiguity. Words are typed the way they are pronounced. Is a 1 to 1 mapping. I don't need to understand what you meant in order to know for certain what you said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. the grammar is very congruent / precise - and is said to have zero exceptions - this makes parsing and meaning extraction easier by orders of magnitude. Ambiguity is still an issue - but a manageable one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In English - we extract meaning and solve ambiguity by relying mostly on statistics. We garter billions of phrases - and based on that we **infer** what is **the most probable meaning of a phrase**. We do this with models based on neural networks - that are black boxes for the most part. Point is - grammar rules are not that useful in English. When you debug your program - you can't clearly see why a certain chunk of text was summarized to a certain phrase. You can use your human intuition - and you can agree or disagree with the summary - but if you disagree - you can't easily inspect the decision that the computer took at each step. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Introduction to the parsing problem is a good place to start.][1] The production systems are more advanced then this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In lojban, by contrast things are simpler: there are only verbs(selbri) and nouns(sumti) - actually is more like - **functions** and **arguments to those functions**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One can heavily rely on rules - and that is enough to get the meaning out with a very high accuracy. And in principle is scalable  .. phrases, paragraphs, pages .. hole speeches, hole books, the entire Wikipedia - a web of meaning.. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So this is why i'm interested in it. A web of meaning - as opposed to a web of data. Right now computers can see **the data** - but they can't see **the meaning**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2. Answer to questions the way an Expert would do it**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another even more interesting use-case for a constructed language is it's ability to provide a sufficient and universal representation of knowledge that is easy to query by computers. We are interested in getting useful answers from big amounts of unstructured data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Google is trying to do this for ages. You still get bad results even for easy to answer questions. The way an expert answers a question - is different from google. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We need more of that expert answer. This is almost always true for complex questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**You want the answer alone** not 10's of articles that might or might not contain the answer - articles that you need to read yourself. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And this situation is primarily because 99.9% of human knowledge is represented as text - mostly in English - which is very hard to parse, and query in a meaningful way. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So one way to solve this - is to have all this knowledge in a system that is easy to query by design. And this is what constructed languages can potentially offer. And i don't mean sql databases - is way better - is in the computation itself. The way we humans do it internally - the computers will be able to do it as well. We are still a far cry form that - but i think this direction is promising..&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. On a personal level. Language might affect the way you think.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is best express by watching an awesome movie like Arrival. or by reading articles [like this][2]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If lojban were to be our default language instead of English - i think our entire civilization we would have been centuries more advanced that we are now - not just technologically - but in general. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm just learning this stuff myself. But hopefully this allows you to see that there are much more practical applications - with very serious consequences then just: &quot;you look more smart in front of your friends&quot; - that is not something would convince me to get trough the struggle of learning a new language. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet there are people that don't struggle that much - for them the other reasons might make more sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntF5cFZq1PA&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/does-language-i-speak-influence-way-i-think" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Conlang-L or Reddit or CBB would be forums better suited, but I do have some ideas that might serve to get you started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it seems like you've got a handle on the basics and are really asking for a directional nudge, I'd suggest the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make a short list (maybe a dozen) of Proto-Language words and sort them by various characteristics: words that begin with a voiceless stop; words that contain a voiced stop followed by a syllabic liquid; words with an accented long vowel root.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Pronounce one of the words over and over and try &quot;permutations in the phonetic neighbourhood&quot; like CWAD**RUT** CWAD**RUT** CHWAD**RUT** CHWADHRUT **CHWAAH**RUTH **HWAAR**RUS HWAARUH **HA**WARƏH **HAW**WAR&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make a note of how certain sounds are &quot;eroded&quot; or, I guess more properly, how they *evolve*. [kw] relaxes into [hw]; [dr] &gt; [ðr] &gt; [r]; as the final syllable weakens, the accent shifts towards the word head; as the accent shifts towards the word head, medial long vowels become shortened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Sit back in astoundment how you've just discovered several sound change rules!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't like that progression, try another one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kind of a simplistic exercise, but it's a good method to start. Eventually, other rules you discover are going to intersect and sometimes abrogate another law. Sometimes two parallel dialects run along slightly different tracks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes dialects are &quot;behind the times&quot; when compared to others, and this will launch you into the wonder world of diachronics. The study of when sound changes occur in a particular place and in what order the changes happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And of course, you're considering a whole family tree, so you're going to need to do this exercise multiple times. You might find that two or three daughter lineages kind of align in certain ways. For example, *cwadrut yields hawar in language A and qewarro in language B and kawrs in language C but shwuntz in language D and shhwandaras in language E.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you examine other words, you notice that ancestral [k-] remains [k] or becomes [h] (both palatal sounds) in several languages, all of which are at the eastern end of this proto language's continuum; while most of the languages where ancestral [k-] has become [ʃ] are all in the west. A nice geographic split (that may or may not actually mean much), much like that which exists within Indo-European languages." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For example, the hypothetical spirantization of [b] to [v] intervocalically could be notated as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; b &gt; v / V__V&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This rule indicates that b becomes v when surrounded by a vowel (V) on each side. The __ indicates a &quot;placeholder&quot; for where the original sound was and where the new sound goes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some other common notations are # for word boundaries and [+feature] or [-feature] to indicate the presence or lack of a certain feature respectively. For example, [final-obstruent devoicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final-obstruent_devoicing) in e.g. Russian could be&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [+stop][+voiced] &gt; [-voiced] / __#&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where the __# means that the stop in question (\__) is at the end of a word (#).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for b), the best way to get an idea for what kinds of things generally happen in languages is honestly probably just by reading about lots of different languages and seeing what tends to happen. Some of the most common general processes are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [**Lenition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition), probably one of the most common sound changes, in which a &quot;softer&quot; sound becomes a &quot;louder&quot; sound. (There are [some general rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonority_hierarchy) that determine what this actually means, although it can vary between languages). A few examples are intervocalic flapping in many English dialects (/bɛtər/ → [bɛɾɚ]) and the pronunciation of /b, d, g/ as fricatives or approximants, roughly [β, ð, ɣ], in most contexts in Spanish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [**Assimilation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(phonology)) is another frequent sound change. This occurs when features of a given phoneme are influenced by the phonemes around it. For example, in English and Spanish, /n/ becomes [m] before bilabials and [ŋ] before velars (e.g. &amp;lt;rainbow&gt; [ɹ̠ʷej**m**bow], &amp;lt;concordar&gt; [ko**ŋ**koɾðaɾ]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Similar ideas are [**umlaut**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(linguistics)) and [**vowel harmony**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_harmony), in which vowels change depending on other vowels in the word. Remnants of Germanic umlaut can be seen in English, e.g. foot/feet, and vowel harmony is prominent in e.g. Turkish, where all of the vowels in a word have to harmonize (for the most part) so that affixes have several different forms (for example, the genitive suffix is [in] after front unrounded vowels, [ɯn] after back unrounded vowels, [yn] after front rounded vowels, and [un] after back rounded vowels).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While there are general patterns, it's also important to note that some sound changes seem completely illogical and random, and just... sort of happen. The most infamous examples are the [ruki rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruki_sound_law), where [s] became [ʃ] but only after [r, w, k, j] (?), and strangest of all, Proto-Indo-European *dw to Armenian erk (???). So you really have a lot of room for creativity here, while still being able to be naturalistic. " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Text="As the linked WALS chapter already mentions, a common distinction is to contrast near speaker/near listener/distal rather than a simple distance constrast. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way to make such as system more &quot;interesting&quot; can be to add additional usages or shades of meaning to the different demonstratives, for example having one be a neutral term and the other one that is only used when specific focus on the distance is desired, or alternatively having a neutral demonstrative in addition to ones overtly marked for distance (the WALS chapter again already has examples of this, mentioning modern Hebrew and Lithuanian respectively). Korafe (TNG, Oro Province PNG) has a 3 demonstratives _e, a, o_ in a speaker/listener/distal system which additionally serve the function of showing emontional evolvement of the speaker in utterance, with _a_ &quot;near listener&quot; being the neutral default, _e_ &quot;near speaker&quot; showing a great deal of involvement and _o_ &quot;distal&quot; showing a desire of the speaker to distance and dissociate him/herself from the utterance[1 pp.75-77][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Variables may be paradigmatically overlaid on top of a distance system, e.g. a visibility contrast as seen in Malagasy(Astronesian, Madagascar)[2][2], or may supplement it, for example by having a 3-way proximal/distal/non-visible contrast. Other contrasts than visibility are possible, for example in Fore(TNG, Eastern Higlands Province PNG), which has a 5-way speaker/listener/proximal/medial/distal system, with proximal and distal further exhibiting a 3-way same level/above/below vertical relationship, for a total of 9 different demonstratives[1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other than overlaying various such contrasts on a system there is also the possibility of instead having a large set of what may be called &quot;positional stems&quot;, whith relatively specific semantics such as &quot;up above&quot;, &quot;on the beach&quot; or &quot;towards the Siberian mainland&quot; which can then either be used as or derived into demonstratives.

There were only a few brief mentions of Solresol throughout the 1900s in books about universal language attempts.

In this system, one demonstrative would point to the larger, more massive, more important, less recently introduced etc., another would point to the smaller, less massive, less important, more recently introduced target. Various degrees of intermediates could be thought of between these two extremes (but I think just one intermediate would be the most obvious choice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More practical examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Two people talking about cars on a road. In a this/that system, one might say:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; I like that huge car.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; while pointing at one. In the system I’m imagining, that would turn into:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; I like [Demonstrative-important] car.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; without the need to point a finger. It would immediately imply the largest car to be seen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A discussion about which colour a dress should be. A blue one was introduced first, a red one second and now we are looking at a green one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; I like [Demonstrative-intermediate] best.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Even though we may be looking at the green one and without turning any heads it would be clear that red is preferred. My train of thoughts here is that the first introduced object has been sitting around for a while in the discussion and thus acquired some sort of importance of the elder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - It can even easily be applied to people. Depending on what the culture of your conlang values, I can imagine both mere height or age/respect factoring into the decision which one of two people would get the important demonstrative. In Japan, if the choice is between the young, tiny professor and the older, larger secretary, the professor would probably be labelled with [demonstrative-important]. But going by age or size alone may make more sense in other cultures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - An interesting feature when applying it to people is that the demonstrative would change depending on who is a potential target. Comparing a teacher to their students would mean they receive [demonstrative-important]. However, if the headmaster is part of the group being talked about, the same teacher would suddenly be [demonstrative-intermediate] or [demonstrative-unimportant].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, many more examples are possible."

The first one semantically modifies the second one; and that's all.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;+ {`lo zdani gerku cu barda`}: The house dog is big.&#xD;&#xA;+ {`lo gerku zdani cu barda`}: The kennel is big.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where {`zdani`} (roughly) means &quot;home&quot;, {`gerku`} means &quot;dog&quot;, and {`barda`} means &quot;big (the rest is grammatical witchcraft, don't bother).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the first example, {`zdani gerku`} is syntactically a _tanru_, and {`zdani`} modifies {`gerku`}. However, the _tanru_ is primarily about {`gerku`}.  &#xD;&#xA;In the second one, it's the reverse. {`gerku zdani`} is also syntactically a _tanru_, but {`gerku`} modifies {`zdani`}; and the overall tanru is about {`zadni`}, not {`gerku`}.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it isn't possible to make assumptions about the overall meaning of a tanru. Though it's syntactically not ambiguous, it is semantically ambiguous.  &#xD;&#xA;I've chosen the english “house dog” and “kennel”, but it was just my intent, and english translates this way. Officially, it's not possible to infer the meaning from a tanru.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can even read yourself in the [last official reference grammar](https://lojban.github.io/cll/5/2/) that “All tanru are ambiguous semantically.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a surer version:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;+ {`lo gerku poi ta'e zvati lo zdani cu barda`}: The dog that uses to live at the house is big&#xD;&#xA;+ {`lo zdani poi zukte ke'a lo nu stuzi lo gerku cu barda`}: The house that is aimed so that dogs could live in is big.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: added an explanation on how it's ambiguous, and the surer examples."

Ergative cases are a little less straightforward, but they very frequently have an oblique double function, hinting at origins such as reinterpretation of passive constructions or the generalisation of usage of e.g. instrumental or ablative case markers as markers of unexpected agency (e.g. via the occasional omission of agents in sentences like &quot;[the man] opened the door **with** the key&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The emergence of accusative cases seem less straightforward to me though, and while reinterpretations of antipassives are a readily availible source that doesn't to me seem like a plausible origin for the majority of accusative markers, nor does it provide a way to go from no case marking to accusative (which seems like a thing that should be able to happen), and I'm not aware of any similar broad tendency of oblique double-function as seen in ergatives which could otherwise hint at origins. As such I particularly would like to know what oblique cases could reasonably be extended to accusative, and under what circumstances the original extension (from which further generalisation could be done) may occur under, and additionally if there are any reasons accusatives seem to have fewer double functions (even if this is just a result of me looking in the wrong places)."

For example linking verbs like is or looks will not be assigned gender because they are used to link the subject to the action verb or to adjectives and adverbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pronouns practically already have gender in them. For example &quot;he&quot; is masculine. However &quot;he&quot; could also be neuter, at least in English because it can be used to refer to someone of unknown gender. &quot;it&quot; is clearly neuter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It does make sense though for all nouns and adjectives to have gender. And again, there are clear examples of where 1 gender makes far more sense. An example of that is the adjective &quot;pregnant&quot; It makes far more sense to say &quot;pregnant&quot; is feminine because male pregnancy, while possible, is extremely rare. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But as for the assigning of gender I figured it would be like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Feminine Masculine Neuter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Latin had this 3 gender system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now I am not so sure I would want inflections from grammatical case. I mean word order is a much simpler way to get across the same ideas as grammatical case. In other words for example instead of having the genitive case you could just use a possession marker on the possessor and either way, you get the same thing across, possession. But the possession marker is way simpler than inflecting every possessable noun for the genitive case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I was wondering, should adjectives agree with the noun in all aspects including gender or would a conlang where adjectives have inherent gender and don't have to agree with the noun when it comes to gender be just fine?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** I don't want to use the concepts in English except maybe the pronouns, I am just using it as an example language for those concepts partly because that is the only language I know to fluency. As for mixing up grammatical gender with biological gender, it isn't really a mix up. It is on purpose that I say that pregnant makes more sense as being feminine and he having 2 genders depending on how it's used. I think it makes more sense to have grammatical gender based on biological gender." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In an interview available on [Unidentified Sound Object][3], he details how the language was devised. The director, James Cameron, had created about 30 words many of which he needed as place names. These helped Frommer understand what kind of sounds Cameron had in mind. They discussed what the language would need to be and sound like in general and then Frommer was on his own. Most notably, the only input from the director was a set of isolated words and confirmation that the primary way to differentiate between them should be stress.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Frommer decided that he wanted to employ all sorts of features of various human languages in a unique combination. Thus:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - verbs are inflected by infixes, not the more common prefix or suffix models (suffix inflection is a feature of [Standard Average European][6])&#xD;&#xA; - the case system is [tripartite][4], a feature which exists but is rarely found in natural languages; SAE would be nominative–accusative&#xD;&#xA; - the language features [ejective consonantes][5]. Again, these are found in about 20 % of the world’s languages but only the Caucasian languages feature them in Europe&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, it seems like any features present in Na’vi that are also present in European languages would be a conscious design choice to not make it too non-European.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, the [interview][3] also briefly mentions Klingon:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; USO: Is there a “gold standard” for constructed language that served as an inspiration to you?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Frommer: In terms of “alien” languages, that would have to be Klingon, the language developed by linguist Marc Okrand for the **Star Trek** series. It’s a very impressive piece of work—a rough-sounding language with a complex and difficult phonology and grammar that now has a devoted base of followers. There are Klingon clubs all over the world where people meet to speak the language, and there’s even a translation of Hamlet into Klingon! If Na’vi ever came close to that kind of following, I’d be delighted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This hints that Klingon, which was also developed by a linguist, would similarly be free from eurocentric bias.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%27vi_language&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://usoproject.blogspot.jp/2009/11/interview-with-paul-frommer-alien.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_language&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is almost not used in international context, like in the Internet (&quot;knuflo&quot; esperanto gives less than 12 results with Google), outside of groups that are community specific. Outside of these groups, the word is not understood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Knuflo is like hugging, but longer, with more parts of the body. It is like cuddling, but it is hard to describe. Users say you have to receive a knuflo to understand it, and you have to experience it to understand why the word is needed in the language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So here, you have three factors. People sharing the same factor tend to speak together. When people speak mainly within their own community, slang appear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Age** factor: Young people coin new words for the **new environment**, and for **concepts that are felt important for the social group**. It is exactly the same in Esperanto. But there is no clear barrier. Here is a [footage of an older person using the word &quot;knuflo&quot;](https://youtu.be/GwHvknlfV-k?t=4m15s).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Location** factor: Not all Esperanto-speakers participate regularly in Esperanto events, in fact only a minority do. There is an **event-slang**, with words such as &quot;gufujo&quot;, &quot;stelo (mono)&quot;, etc. Esperanto events are often attended by people from neighboring countries. This way local slang is shared among people of different countries and age. Because of this, you can sometimes hear &quot;knuflo&quot; in French speaking Belgium and Germany (near the Netherlands). The word is also shared in huge international youth events like JES and IJK, where a consequent number of participants come from the knuflo-region.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Language** factor: &quot;knuflo&quot; comes directly from the dutch verb &quot;knufelen&quot;. Dutch-speaking beginners who are not aware of similar words like &quot;brakumo&quot; &quot;kareso&quot; &quot;dorlotado&quot; are more likely to remember and understand &quot;knuflo&quot;. This kind of **beginner-slang** tend to not go outside the local club, but &quot;knuflo&quot; is an odd exception. Maybe because some local experienced speakers think it brings new meaning."

I have also seen a different distinction made, where analytic languages have a low morpheme-per-word ratio and isolating languages have a morpheme-per-word ratio of 1:1, though this one is less common in my experience. The fact that even with this distinction isolating languages end up being a proper subset of analytic languages only makes this problem worse. This has its origins in the definition of &quot;synthetic&quot;, the category both of these are typically contrasted with, since it's used both as a description of languages with a high morpheme-per-word ratio and as a description of the superset of terms like fusional and agglutinative, both of which describe languages with lots of inflection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice, conlangers seem to make too big of a deal out of these sorts of labels.

Why? Well, strong Sapir-Whorf is pretty much a settled question in linguistics -- the vast majority of the field agrees it's not the case -- and weak Sapir-Whorf is more likely to be tested on natlangs for many reasons, not least of which is the number of potential subjects. Even the most popular conlangs have much smaller speaker communities compared to most natlangs, and so even if conlangs and natlangs were equal in all other ways when it came to this research (and from a linguist's perspective, they really aren't), it would be far harder to gather subjects and conduct research for the conlangs."

They did hire linguist Jessica Coon to consult on the film, and she annotated printouts of the logograms so that the set designers would know what to put in the background and on the whiteboards (if I remember correctly, they consulted physicists for similar work as well). They also had Stephen and Christopher Wolfram provide some analysis and design the computer program used to analyze and generate them in the film. But in the end, the movie was not for linguists or conlangers, so they did not design it as a fully-fledged conlang -- and given that it's supposed to be a mystery that they don't quite solve in the film, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These articles might interest you if you want more information:&#xD;&#xA;https://www.wired.com/2016/11/arrivals-designers-crafted-mesmerizing-alien-alphabet/&#xD;&#xA;http://www.businessinsider.com/alien-language-in-arrival-linguist-2016-11" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This occurs when a string that is an affix also occurs within a root word. For example, the suffix *-em* means &quot;a tendency/propensity for...&quot;, deriving words like *kompatema* &quot;charitable&quot; and *kompatemo* &quot;charity/mercifulness&quot; from *kompato* &quot;compasson, pity&quot;. However, what of a word like *modemo*? The root *mod-* means &quot;fashion&quot;, so upon encountering this word you might assume it means &quot;having a tendency to be fashionable&quot; or something like that, but it's also a root of its own meaning &quot;modem&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, realistically, this would be distinguishable from context, but then again that's the case for &quot;watt&quot; vs. &quot;cotton wool&quot; too.

Danish has a rather limited case of this in bare complements to perception verbs, where the two reflexives _sig_ and _sig selv_ which are usually either only different in level of emphasis or in complementary distribution, respectively require non-local and local antecedents:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Holger hørte Peter tale om sig.  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Holger hørte Peter tale om sig selv.  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Holger hørte Peter tale om ham.  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**&quot;4th Person systems&quot;** such as seen Eskimo languages are rather similar, though more general as they are used in all subordinate clauses are also another type of reflexive-like construction (the &quot;fourth&quot; person is often labeled 3R) and they are also used intraclausally in possessive marking. In all of these cases they mark that a participant or possessor is coreferential with the subject of the main clause (which is defined in terms of S/A despite the case marking being ergative). An example from [Siberian Yupik][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; esghaghyagu quyaaq  &#xD;&#xA;`see:CNSQ:3s&gt;3s happy:IND.3s`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; esghaghyamigu quyaaq  &#xD;&#xA;`see:CNSQ:3Rs&gt;3s happy:IND.3s`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; esghaghyatni quyaaq  &#xD;&#xA;`see:CNSQ:3s&gt;3Rs happy:IND.3s`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to all these various reflexive constructions, **switch reference**, the overt marking of whether the &quot;subject&quot; is either the same or different, either between two coordinate clauses, or a subordinate and main clause can also resolve some ambiguity. Take for example this pair of sentences from Hua:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ebgi-Ø-na korihie  &#xD;&#xA;`hit-SAME-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ran away&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ebgi-ga-na korihie  &#xD;&#xA;`hit-3sg.DIFF-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg`  &#xD;&#xA;*&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; ran away&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Switch reference can only deal with one set of coreference though what exactly is tracked varies. In some languages, it is specifically the actor that is tracked, while others may track the topic or some other pragmatically prominent NP, or may even differ in what is tracked in the controlling clause as opposed to the clause recieving the marking. Additionally the marking may occasionally also be sensitive to changes in things like time, place, discourse coherency and/or reality status, and as a result, switch reference may fulfill may other roles than simply dealing with ambiguity.

This can most easily be shown by rearranging the sentence as such:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To know one's own mind is the one self-knowledge worth having.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, &quot;worth&quot; here is an adjective¹.

This is often explained in simple terms using the W questions: ***w**ho* is doing something, ***w**hat* are they doing, *ho**w*** are they doing it, *to **w**hom* are they doing it, ***w**hen* and ***w**here* are they doing it, etc. In grammatical terms, these can be labelled as subject, verb, adverbs, objects, adverbials and more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some languages, quite a few categories are distinguishable *a priori* just by their ending. For example in [Esperanto][1], singular nouns are marked with terminal *-o*, adjectives end in *-a* and conjugated verbs usually in *-[vowel]s*. Likewise, a general knowledge of the conjugation tables of Finnish often allows a quick and dirty rough estimate whether a word happens to a noun or adjective or a verb form. English is generally terrible at this distinction with a number of words being written and pronounced the same regardless of the category (see: [Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, what is mentioned in the paragraph above only accounts for the word type; if a sentence has two nouns we may not immediately be able to distinguish between the subject noun and the object noun without additional information. Thus, languages generally use one of two methods to clarify what exactly is meant:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The information is encoded in word order. This is often the rule for languages with rather low levels of inflection such as English or Chinese. In English, the following two sentences are different because of the different subject and object functions even though all the words are the same:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The man bites the dog.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The dog bites the man.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. The information is encoded in inflection, prepositions, participles, suffixes and the like. While very likely all languages make use of this scheme partially, some do to a much larger extent than English; for example German or Finnish. In German and Finnish, the following two sentences with the same words but different order mean *the same:*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Der Mann beißt den Hund.  &#xD;&#xA; &gt; Mies puree koiraa.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Den Hund beißt der Mann.  &#xD;&#xA; &gt; Koiraa puree mies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; (I’m not sure if the second Finnish example is strictly allowed in that way; however, my Finnish course includes a  similar precedence of an OVS sentence).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; By marking the nouns according to case — and thus, according to their grammatic function — we have one clear subject (the agent, the man; nominative case in both examples) and one clear object (the patient, the dog; accusative or partitive case). Once the relation between the two is established like this, one is typically free to move the components around.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other than using declension by case, modifiers can be placed around a word. In Japanese, that would be the particles が, は, を, に, へ and others. The word or phrase that precedes the particle が is understood to be the subject of a sentence, whatever precedes を is an object. In theory, this would allow the parts suffixed in that way to be moved around as seen fit. (Whether Japanese actually does that I do not know as my knowledge of it is still too basic.) Other options of the same general flavour include prepositions: ***in** the house* shows that the house is used to denote location and is not an agent or a patient of the sentence. Even in the otherwise relatively strict word order of English, adverbials such as that can be moved around to a certain degree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**tl;dr:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Languages that allow a more or less free word order will not rely on word order to assign syntactical roles. Instead, markers or modifiers of certain types will likely be used; cases and declension being a rather common choice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The CEO of the Loglan Institute, Randall Holmes, has written periodic reports on the language; [the one from 2015](http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/loglan.org/holmes_stuff/fall2015loglanreport.pdf) shows that several speakers have proposed changes, including the addition of new words (see Appendix 9).

It's clearly non-zero, but not by much - perhaps 10 or 20 people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, the question of whether Loglan is dead or alive rests in part on how you define a [&quot;dead language&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_language). I don't think anybody has ever learned Loglan or Lojban as a native language; you could therefore argue that it was never alive in the first place. So I suppose the best answer to your questions is that yes, Loglan is still being used and changed, but it's not &quot;alive&quot; in the sense of most languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Loglan Institute [considers Loglan to be alive](http://www.loglan.org/what-is-loglan.html) because of the constant grammar/vocabulary changes; they define a dead language as one that isn't evolving.

Brown's scores - and, in a sense, the LLG's - were explicitly based on learnability, which is why these languages were used.

Regardless of which point of the [**Triangle**](http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html#gnoli-triang) your language most closely identifies with, there is plenty of room for whatever you might want to put in there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, yes, indeed, be it auxlang or artlang or engelang, an invented language shòuld have irregular verbs (irregular nouns, irregular adverbs, irregular interjections, etc) if that's what is required by the language for it to be true to itself within its context and also be an accurate projection of the glossopoet's vision for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet also, no, indeed, be it auxlang or artlang or engelang, an invented language should nèver have irregular forms of any kind. If they cause the language to run afoul of its creator's vision for it, then they are inappropriate to the work of art being created. Or if such irregularities would in any way foul up the language's subcreated realism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some respects, there may be matters of taste or audience expectation involved. For example, I think most language inventors would argue that auxlangs should be as irregularity free as possible. I'd argue the opposite, but that is indeed a matter of taste and sense of plausibility. Perhaps also a nod to a future where the auxlang in question shall have conquered all others and taken its rightful place as the naturalised L2 of the entire world. Irregularities are bound to creep into such a system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no particular benefit one way or the other *external to the invented language*. I don't think a perfectly regular system is any easier to learn. It's not inherently better to be irregularity free. *Within the language*, it might be argued that verisimilitude and plausibility (leastways of human language) demand some amount of irregularity. Surely that might be seen as a benefit, perhaps for a language within a fictional setting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, yeah. Put em in or leave em out. Dealer's choice.

It is common for languages to have more than one of these, and to my knowledge all free word order natural languages have either case or verbal agreement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# [Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Case refers to grammatical markers attached to nouns which indicate the noun's role in the sentence. Some languages have very large noun inventories, but in general you can expect such a language to have at least two cases: nominative and accusative, or ergative and absolutive. Here is an example from [Walmajarri](http://www.ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%202_0.pdf):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    parri-ngu  pa   manga-Ø   nyanya&#xD;&#xA;    boy-subj   AUX  girl-obj  saw&#xD;&#xA;    'The boy saw the girl.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    parri-Ø  pa   nyanya  manga-ngu&#xD;&#xA;    boy-obj  AUX  saw     girl-subj&#xD;&#xA;    'The girl saw the boy.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Walmajarri `ngu` is the ergative case marker. Walmajarri has a null absolutive case marker, shown here as `Ø`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# [Verb aggreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second strategy is agreement, where markers are attached to the verb to give information about the subject and object. Depending on the language, these markers might indicate the person, number, or gender of each noun. Here's an example, again from [Walmajarri](http://ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%201_0.pdf):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    nayili  nya-ka-kyaka-ji-pila&#xD;&#xA;    north   see-IRR-REDUP-1sgO-3dlS&#xD;&#xA;    'You two watch out for me in the north.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here the verb has two suffixes (actually clitics), `-ji` and `-pila`, which mean a 1st person singular object, and a 3rd person dual subject. While it is most common for these verbal agreement markers to be attached to the verbs, in some languages they are attached to other elements in the sentence. In Walmajarri the most common sentence form actually has these markers attaching to a modal auxiliary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ngayirta  ma-rnalu     majurra  kang-ka-rla&#xD;&#xA;    NEG       AUX-1plincS  matches  carry-IRR-PAST&#xD;&#xA;    'We didn't take matches.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here `ma` is the unmarked modal auxiliary, to which `-rnalu` is attached, the marker for a 1st person plural inclusive subject. Matches is a third person singular object and so has a null marker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# [Incorporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(linguistics))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The third strategy is incorporation, where a language productively forms compound words where the verb includes the object. English doesn't do this very productively - our compounds are more like individual set combinations. So in the verb *babysit* the object *baby* is incorporated, but the meaning of the compound is not obviously derived from its component parts.

Without doing that, people jump to weird conclusions based on terminology used in their native natlang's tradition. Thus, linguists use the words &quot;temporal reference&quot; and &quot;aspectual reference&quot; to describe the abstract ideas being described, while the words &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;aspect&quot; are reserved for when such reference is marked grammatically. This is particularly important when you encounter grammatical expressions that mark combinations of temporal and aspectual reference -- these are often referred to as tenses, but in reality it's more complicated than that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The simplified explanation for tense and aspect usually given is that tense describes when an event occurs and aspect describes the internal temporal structure of an event. This is mostly right, and if you operate under these definitions you probably won't suffer. However, it doesn't give a ton of easy answers to &quot;is this grammatical form marking tense, aspect, or both?&quot; Formal semanticists actually have a relatively simple framework for how temporal reference and aspectual reference are defined. While their resulting formalisms can look pretty damn frightening, the basic concepts can be helpful for one who wants to know what the differences between these are and perhaps to invent their own tenses and aspects for their conlang.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The framework used by formal semanticists for temporal and aspectual reference is known as the Neo-Reichenbachian model. Now if that name makes you want to throw yourself off a waterfall, don't worry; it's not as complicated as it sounds. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine a timeline. Let's define temporal reference as the relationship between two sections of that timeline -- the time when you make an utterance (the utterance time or UT) and the time that you're talking *about* (the topic time or TT). This seems pretty intuitive -- if the section of the timeline you're talking about precedes the time you make the utterance, you'll use the past tense; if it follows it, you'll use the future; and if they overlap, you'll use the present. Simple, right?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what of aspect? Well, aspectual reference isn't as transparent at that. To describe aspectual reference, we'll need to pick out a third section of that timeline -- the time when the event being described actually happened (the eventuality time or ET).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;But wait!&quot; you might object. &quot;Isn't that the same as the topic time? If I'm describing something that happened, surely the time I was talking about is the same as the time that it happened.&quot; It seems like it would be, yes, but think about something like the perfect (also known as retrospective aspectual reference by people who hate that &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;perfective&quot; are two different things). In &quot;I have gone to the store,&quot; the event that occurred, my going to the store, occurred in the past. It precedes the utterance time. However, the sentence is in the present tense, as we can see from the form of &quot;have&quot;. It has present temporal reference too, because you can't say &quot;I have gone to the store yesterday.&quot; This all is because the time that's relevant, the one we care about, the *topic time*, is the present. You're saying that right now, it is the case that you previously went to the store.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This doesn't just have to be before/after relationships, either. The prototypical aspectual references, perfective and imperfective, are actually in subset/superset relationships. Perfective aspectual reference is when the ET is completely contained within the TT, i.e., when the event is being viewed in its entirety. Imperfective aspectual reference is the reverse, when the TT is completely contained within the ET, i.e., when the event is being viewed as an ongoing span of time. While there are other factors involved in natlang perfective and imperfective forms (and it gets very technical very quickly in the formal semantics literature), these relationships capture a lot about the meanings involved here, and you can easily imagine how other aspects could be captured in this system -- and how you could invent your own aspects without necessarily having encountered them in natlangs yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Spatial prepositions and adverbs are often derived from relevant body parts: front from face, forehead, nose, chest; back from back or butt; up from head… you get the picture. Basically every organ has been referred to as being the cause of emotions etc as well in metaphors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Words for **directions** in particular are also somewhat based on human anatomy. We have lateral symmetry (left-right) but an alien could likely have some form of radial symmetry in their bodies, which would make the concepts of leftness and rightness very weird to them. Aquatic beings would also likely have a different concept of directions altogether, probably based more on the orientation of their own bodies than relative to the ground.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those are the things that come to mind. However, much more importantly, the inner workings of language as a whole would likely be different from a human’s. There are some things in human language that you really wouldn’t assume to be necessary. Just to make two examples: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems pretty clear that humans take the raw audio input, break it into **segments** (phones) then further abstract those phones into **phonemes**, which are then in turn used to build more complex words. One could just as well imagine skipping the segmentation step and going directly from audio to meaning. There appears to be evidence however that some songbirds also employ what could be considered phonemes in their songs, so perhaps it is to be expected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing is in syntax: human language does not appear to allow circular dependencies, that is word¹ A modifying word B, which in turn modifies word A again. From my fairly limited understanding of syntax, human sentences can be structured in a tree structure. It seems plausible that an alien language might have more or less freedom, perhaps allowing cyclic graphs in their syntax… or in the other direction, only linear dependence. An example of an alien conlang playing around with this is [Europan](http://jbr.me.uk/euro/index.html), which I personally consider one of the most interesting conlangs I’ve ever encountered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;¹or clause" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In contrast tense (at its most basic degree, ignoring semantic expansion) is interested to whether it happens before or after now, and aspect with overall temporal relation (hence the possibility of contrast between tenses within a given aspect).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rosenfelder describes Palmer's classification of modals like so:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Factual&#xD;&#xA;  - Epistemic: speculative, assumptive &amp; deductive&#xD;&#xA;  - Evidential: reported, sensory &amp; deductive&#xD;&#xA; - Deontic&#xD;&#xA;  - External: obligative, permissive, commissive&#xD;&#xA;  - Internal: abilitive &amp; volitive&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Most discussions bundle all of the &quot;factual&quot; branch as one &quot;evidentials&quot; category because languages with evidentials tend to have only one of the two sub-branches, which is also why deductive is listed twice without being self-contradictory)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically working from that, a **mood** is *what happen when modality bundles up with tense*, and there it gets a little messy. Terminologically, Rosenfelder believes that indicative/subjunctive and realis/irrealis systems are separated more clearly by geography (specialists in given language families prefer one or the other) than grammatical reality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In any case, realis/indicative applies protoypically to real events, irrealis/subjunctive to &quot;less real&quot; stuff. What is included in each category may vary considerably (future events and imperative may categorize in either one, for example, depending on individual languages). Conditionals are irrealis in virtually all systems, but in Indo-European linguistics are traditionally treated as a third mood separate from both indicative and subjunctive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice, moods are often more of a semantic division within the verbal paradigm owing to the lack of a separate marker for them (in most European languages I'm aware of, for example). When an explicit irrealis marker exists, it often takes over separate marking for tense and aspect, that is, there will be no overt marking of the subcategories like future vs. imperative (both only irrealis) or past vs. present (both realis). [Manam][1] is such a language (how unusual this is is unclear from Rosenfelder's writing).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manam_language#Mood" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Without doing that, people jump to weird conclusions based on terminology used in their native natlang's tradition. Thus, linguists use the words &quot;temporal reference&quot; and &quot;aspectual reference&quot; to describe the abstract ideas being described, while the words &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;aspect&quot; are reserved for when such reference is marked grammatically. This is particularly important when you encounter grammatical expressions that mark combinations of temporal and aspectual reference -- these are often referred to as tenses, but in reality it's more complicated than that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The simplified explanation for tense and aspect usually given is that tense describes when an event occurs and aspect describes the internal temporal structure of an event. This is mostly right, and if you operate under these definitions you probably won't suffer. However, it doesn't give a ton of easy answers to &quot;is this grammatical form marking tense, aspect, or both?&quot; Formal semanticists actually have a relatively simple framework for how temporal reference and aspectual reference are defined. While their resulting formalisms can look pretty damn frightening, the basic concepts can be helpful for one who wants to know what the differences between these are and perhaps to invent their own tenses and aspects for their conlang.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The framework used by formal semanticists for temporal and aspectual reference is known as the Neo-Reichenbachian model. Now if that name makes you want to throw yourself off a waterfall, don't worry; it's not as complicated as it sounds. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine a timeline.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;                     Earlier                                          Later&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's imagine there are two spans on that timeline (the fact that they're spans is important -- nothing is truly instantaneous). The time when you make an utterance is called the utterance time (or UT), and the time that you're talking *about* is called the topic time (or TT). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Temporal reference describes the relationship between the TT and UT**. Past temporal reference is when the TT precedes the UT; future temporal reference when the TT follows the UT; and present temporal reference when they overlap. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            Past:&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;--------|__TT__|----------------|__UT__|----&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            Future:&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;-----|__UT__|-----------------|__TT__|------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            Present:&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;----------------|___TT__|==UT==|__|---------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems pretty intuitive -- if the section of the timeline you're talking about precedes the time you make the utterance, you'll use the past tense; if it follows it, you'll use the future; and if they overlap, you'll use the present. Simple, right?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what of aspect? Well, aspectual reference isn't as transparent at that. To describe aspectual reference, we'll need to pick out a third span that timeline -- the time when the event being described actually happened. We'll call this the eventuality time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;But wait!&quot; you might object. &quot;Isn't that the same as the topic time? If I'm describing something that happened, surely the time I was talking about is the same as the time that it happened.&quot; However, there is a difference, and it's exactly this difference that gives rise to aspectual reference. Consider the English past perfect in a sentence like the following: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yesterday he had gone to the store.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The English past tense includes past temporal reference, and we've established that this means that the topic time is before the utterance time -- something which is explicitly confirmed by the temporal adverb &quot;yesterday&quot; giving us a more specific topic time. But when does the him-going-to-the-store happen? Probably not yesterday, right? Well, this is because perfect† aspectual reference is when the *eventuality time* precedes the *topic time* -- **aspectual reference describes the relationship between the eventuality time and the topic time**. It for this reason that the past perfect is used by English speakers for the past-in-past.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            Past Perfect:&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;-----|__ET__|----|__TT__|-----|__UT__|------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you can also have the present perfect, right? Well, let's combine our descriptions of the present tense and the perfect aspect and see what we come up with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            Present Perfect:&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;---|__ET__|-----|___TT__|==UT==|__|---------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, the topic time and utterance time overlap, which is why you can't say something like &quot;Yesterday he has gone to the store.&quot; However, the eventuality time precedes the topic time, so *you're describing an event that happened in the past in relation to the present*. And indeed, this is how we see the present perfect used in English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is far from the most interesting thing aspectual reference can do, however. Let's discuss the popular aspectual references, perfective and imperfect. For those who don't know, perfective and perfect are two different things. Perfective is often described as simply viewing an event as a point on a timeline, and imperfect as viewing it as a span. How do we define this as a relationship between eventuality time and topic time?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, a simple way people do it (ignoring a few other related thorny semantic problems that few here will care about) is by defining the perfective as when the eventuality time is contained within the topic time and the imperfect as when the topic time is contained within the eventuality time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            Past Perfective:&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;--------|___TT__|=ET=|__|-----|__UT__|----&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            Past Imperfect:&#xD;&#xA;                          &lt;--------|___ET__|=TT=|__|-----|__UT__|----&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This results, at least formally, in the same sort of perspective shift we try to intuitively describe as changing the event from a &quot;point&quot; to a &quot;span&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that tense and aspect vary between languages a *lot*, and even related languages can't be counted upon to have the same semantics here. After all, the French passé composé, while very similar in form to the English present perfect, does not share the same semantics (it's more of a perfective). Additionally, while a given language's system of tense and aspect will often combine a tense and an aspect in a certain inflection (such as the perfective past tenses in many European languages), this doesn't mean the two are wed cross-linguistically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, I hope this answer has given some conlangers the tools to try and invent their own tenses, aspects, or combinations of the two that they haven't themselves encountered cross-linguistically. Be creative!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short:&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Tense is grammaticalized of temporal reference.&#xD;&#xA;- Aspect is grammaticalized of aspectual reference.&#xD;&#xA;- Temporal reference is the relationship between the utterance time (when you say something) and the topic time (the time relevant to the discussion at hand).&#xD;&#xA;- Aspectual reference is the relationship between the topic time (see above) and the eventuality time (the time when the event being described actually occured).&#xD;&#xA;- Things called &quot;tenses&quot; in natural languages (as well as in conlangs, to be honest) are often conflations of tense and aspect (and sometimes even mood, but we're not here to talk about that).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;†When I refer to perfect aspectual reference, I'm actually more specifically describing what is known in semantics as the existential perfect. Perfect forms in English and many other languages include other types of perfect aspectual reference (universal, resultive, etc.) that differ subtly in their semantics, and other aspectual and temporal baggage as well; this is, however, probably not particularly interesting or relevant to most people here at this moment.

(habitual)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am eating sushi. (continuous)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I used to eat sushi. (habitual)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I ate sushi.

(perfect)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I will be eating sushi. (continuous)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know if someone has a complete list of possible aspects, but here are some possibilities:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The action was/is/will be finished (perfect)&#xD;&#xA; 2. The action is/was/will be ongoing (continuous)&#xD;&#xA; 3. The action is/was/will be continually performed (habitual)&#xD;&#xA; 4. The action is/was/will be going to start (inceptive)&#xD;&#xA; 5. The action is/was/will be intermitently performed (iterative)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's the difference. Now comes the confusion - because that is what languages do, they confuse tense and aspect, in incoherent and incomplete systems that fail to either integrate or clearly separate those features.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One first source of confusion is that many languages operate not only with the simple distinction between tenses as outlined above - past, present, future - but also with dependent and independent tenses. For instance, I may say&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I used to eat sushi when Susan introduced me to Javanese food.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am eating sushi while the president threats nuclear war against North Korea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I will be eating sushi when they bring the wine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;in which one action is past, present or future regarding the time of the speech (Susan introduced me to Javanese food in the past, the president is threatening nuclear war in the present, they will bring wine in the future) while the other (me eating sushi) happens in the present - not the present regarding the time of speech, however, but the present regarding the other action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And while this may be a source of confusion by itself, it expands to a further level of confusion because the interaction between dependent and independent action often has implications on the aspectuality of each of them. For instance, I say&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I eat sushi. - or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am eating sushi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;it is understood that these are different aspects: in the first sentence, I am saying that I do habitually eat sushi, not that I have a dish of sushi in front of me. In the second sentence, however, I am saying that I am actually eating sushi in the moment I am talking, so the sentences are not synonim to each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But if I say&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I eat sushi. - or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I am eating sushi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;the phrase &quot;eat sushi&quot; loses its habitual aspect, and turn into continuous, and the sentences are effectively synonimous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The there is the confusion that Sparksbet remarks, between &quot;tense&quot; as a grammatical form, and &quot;tense&quot; as a reference to actual time. As she says, &quot;tenses&quot; as grammatical forms are used to denote a mix of tense references and aspectual references.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, while the tense and aspectual references can be several, their grammaticalization, or lack thereof, is much more constrained. For instance, neither English, nor any other Western European language that I know has verb inflections for iterative or inceptive aspects. They instead use either syntactical devices, or morphological derivation - and those often vary weirdly from lexical item to lexical item. Let's take for instance Portuguese:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Eu como sushi* (habitual)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Estou comendo sushi* (continuous)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Estou beliscando uns sushis* (iterative) (where a different verb is used to make the aspectual reference)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Eu bebo uísque* (habitual)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Estou bebendo uísque* (continuous)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Estou bebericando uísque* (iterative) (where a morphological derivation of &quot;beber&quot; is used to make the aspectual reference)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, probably no natural language has a coherent tense-aspect system; the fact that some tenses seem to imply some aspects when put in relation to others probably means that, for reasons of economy, grammatical &quot;tenses&quot; will be used irregularly, given internal or even external context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Could it be possible to build a conlang with a complete and coherent tense-aspect system? Perhaps, but I would say such coherence and completeness are only going to survive as long as the language is not effectively used by a human population." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

How do we define this as a relationship between eventuality time and topic time?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, a simple way people do it (ignoring a few other related thorny semantic problems that few here will care about) is by defining the perfective as when the eventuality time is contained within the topic time and the imperfect as when the topic time is contained within the eventuality time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Past Perfective:&#xD;&#xA;                   |--ET--|&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            |-------TT-------|        |--UT--|     &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Past Imperfect:&#xD;&#xA;                   |--TT--|&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            |-------ET-------|        |--UT--|     &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This results, at least formally, in the same sort of perspective shift we try to intuitively describe as changing the event from a &quot;point&quot; to a &quot;span&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that tense and aspect vary between languages a *lot*, and even related languages can't be counted upon to have the same semantics here. After all, the French passé composé, while very similar in form to the English present perfect, does not share the same semantics (it's more of a perfective). Additionally, while a given language's system of tense and aspect will often combine a tense and an aspect in a certain inflection (such as the perfective past tenses in many European languages), this doesn't mean the two are wed cross-linguistically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, I hope this answer has given some conlangers the tools to try and invent their own tenses, aspects, or combinations of the two that they haven't themselves encountered cross-linguistically. Be creative!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short:&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Tense is grammaticalized of temporal reference.&#xD;&#xA;- Aspect is grammaticalized of aspectual reference.&#xD;&#xA;- Temporal reference is the relationship between the utterance time (when you say something) and the topic time (the time relevant to the discussion at hand).&#xD;&#xA;- Aspectual reference is the relationship between the topic time (see above) and the eventuality time (the time when the event being described actually occured).&#xD;&#xA;- Things called &quot;tenses&quot; in natural languages (as well as in conlangs, to be honest) are often conflations of tense and aspect (and sometimes even mood, but we're not here to talk about that).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;†When I refer to perfect aspectual reference, I'm actually more specifically describing what is known in semantics as the existential perfect. Perfect forms in English and many other languages include other types of perfect aspectual reference (universal, resultive, etc.) that differ subtly in their semantics, and other aspectual and temporal baggage as well; this is, however, probably not particularly interesting or relevant to most people here at this moment.

Thus, linguists use the words **temporal reference** and **aspectual reference** to describe the abstract ideas being described, while the words **tense** and **aspect** are reserved for when such reference is marked grammatically. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The simplified explanation for tense and aspect usually given is that tense describes when an event occurs and aspect describes the internal temporal structure of an event. However, this doesn't give a ton of easy answers to &quot;is this grammatical form marking tense, aspect, or both?&quot; Formal semanticists actually have a relatively simple framework for how temporal reference and aspectual reference are defined, the basic concepts of which can be helpful when designing your conlang's own tense/aspect system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Neo-Reichenbachian Model&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine a timeline:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Earlier                                  Later&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, imagine there are two spans on that timeline (the fact that they're spans is important -- nothing is truly instantaneous). The time when you make an utterance is called the **utterance time** (or UT), and the time that you're talking *about* is called the **topic time** (or TT). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Temporal reference describes the relationship between the TT and UT**. Past temporal reference is when the TT precedes the UT; future temporal reference when the TT follows the UT; and present temporal reference when they overlap. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Past:&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                    |--TT--|          |--UT--|&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Future:&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;              |--UT--|                  |--TT--|&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Present:&#xD;&#xA;                                |--UT--|&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                         |-------TT-------|&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems pretty intuitive -- if the section of the timeline you're talking about precedes the time you make the utterance, you'll use the past tense; if it follows it, you'll use the future; and if they overlap, you'll use the present. Simple, right?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what of aspect? Well, aspectual reference isn't as transparent at that. To describe aspectual reference, we'll need to pick out a third span that timeline -- the time when the event being described actually happened. We'll call this the **eventuality time** (or ET).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;But wait!&quot; you might object. &quot;Isn't that the same as the topic time? If I'm describing something that happened, surely the time I was talking about is the same as the time that it happened.&quot; However, there is a difference, and it's exactly this difference that gives rise to aspectual reference. Consider the English past perfect in a sentence like the following: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yesterday he had gone to the store.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The English past tense includes past temporal reference, and we've established that this means that the topic time is before the utterance time -- something which is explicitly confirmed by the temporal adverb &quot;yesterday&quot; giving us a more specific topic time. But when does the him-going-to-the-store happen? Probably not yesterday, right? Well, this is because perfect† aspectual reference is when the *eventuality time* precedes the *topic time* -- **aspectual reference describes the relationship between the eventuality time and the topic time**. It for this reason that the past perfect is used by English speakers for the past-in-past.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Past Perfect:&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;              |--ET--|    |--TT--|     |--UT--|&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you can also have the present perfect, right? Well, let's combine our descriptions of the present tense and the perfect aspect and see what we come up with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Present Perfect:&#xD;&#xA;                                |--UT--|&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            |--ET--|     |-------TT-------|&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, the topic time and utterance time overlap, which is why you can't say something like &quot;Yesterday he has gone to the store.&quot; However, the eventuality time precedes the topic time, so *you're describing an event that happened in the past in relation to the present*. And indeed, this is how we see the present perfect used in English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is far from the most interesting thing aspectual reference can do, however. Let's discuss the popular aspectual references, perfective and imperfect. For those who don't know, perfective and perfect are two different things. Perfective is often described as simply viewing an event as a point on a timeline, and imperfect as viewing it as a span.

We examined the geographic coordinates and elevations of 567 language locations represented in a worldwide phonetic database.

In addition, the mean and median elevations of the locations of languages with ejectives were found to be comparatively high. [...] we offer two plausible motivations for [this correlation's] existence. We suggest that **ejective sounds might be facilitated at higher elevations due to the associated decrease in ambient air pressure, which reduces the physiological effort required for the compression of air in the pharyngeal cavity**–a unique articulatory component of ejective sounds. In addition, we hypothesize that **ejective sounds may help to mitigate rates of water vapor loss through exhaled air**.

I now recall it - and though the persons concerned having died long since makes my little anecdote mere hearsay and in no way veridical, I thought I'd forward it. An old friend, a retired military man with an amateur interest in codes and cyphers, once showed me a couple of not entirely distinct b&amp;w copies of pages from a curious coded manuscript, which I now realise were a couple of folios of the VMs. I was not especially interested in them at the time, I think, but the reason that the incident made an impression was that he said that they had been given to him by Prof JRR Tolkien. At that time I had just discovered and was very much 'into' Tolkien so I was most envious of my friend's knowing him and pressed for details of the great man, though in the end I never achieved my longed-for personal introduction. So I now wonder if there might be any reference anywhere in the mass of Tolkien papers to our VMs, and is this of any possible slight significance? After all, JRRT knew a great deal about languages and artificial scripts of course and if he was interested enough to make and pass on copies to a friend, he might have devoted some time to the VMs himself. And the Voynichese script does have a Tolkien-ish look to it or vice versa: could it have influenced him?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(this was found through a link from [CipherMysteries.com](http://ciphermysteries.com/2008/01/16/voynich-manuscript-in-existing-novels))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, since his development started before the Voynich manuscript was discovered, I'd say that it's... kinda *unlikely* that he was inspired by it."

These are listed in a more readable-to-laymen way in [the wikipedia article on the subject][2]. Haspelmath included as true Europeanisms (that is, features that are part of the SAE [Sprachbund][3]) only features that fit the following requirements:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Most of the &quot;core&quot; European languages possess it.&#xD;&#xA;2. Nearby languages (Celtic, Turkic, etc.) lack it.&#xD;&#xA;3. Eastern Indo-European languages (Armenian, Iranian, Indic languages, etc.) lack it -- this prevents us from merely calling it a feature of the Indo-European language family as a whole.&#xD;&#xA;4. It is not found in the majority of the world's languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Europeanisms identified by Haspelmath that fit this criteria include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Definite and indefinite articles&#xD;&#xA;- Post-nominal relative clauses with resumptive relative pronouns&#xD;&#xA;- The (transitive) perfect formed with &quot;have&quot; plus a past participle&#xD;&#xA;- [Experiencers][4] coded as nominative subjects&#xD;&#xA;- Passive formed with a participle plus &quot;to be&quot;&#xD;&#xA;- A preference for [anticausatives][5] over [causatives][6].&#xD;&#xA;- [Dative external possession][7]&#xD;&#xA;- Negation with negative pronouns and positive verb forms (e.g., &quot;Nobody comes&quot; instead of &quot;Nobody won't come.&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;- [Particle comparatives][8]&#xD;&#xA;- Relative-clause based equative constructions (e.g., &quot;*tan* Z *como* X&quot;, &quot;*so* Z *wie* X&quot;, &quot;as Z as X&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;- Different forms for reflexives vs. intensifiers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He also identified several other features that were common among this Sprachbund but were not as well-documented as the above, such as the verb fronting of polar interrogatives (i.e., turning &quot;I have done it&quot; into &quot;Have I done it?&quot; to make a yes/no question), an inflectional marker for the comparative, and several others -- these are also included in the linked articles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachbund&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_relation&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticausative_verb&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalienable_possession#External_possession&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://wals.info/chapter/121" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Not only does this show that the conlang community has a strong Eurocentric bias, I think it shows it has a massive **Anglocentric** bias! Because it is English which is so strongly tense prominent. Most other current European languages also mark aspect or modality, but English doesn't even have a full aspect inflectional system, just the continuous *-ing*. Some European languages arguably don't even have tense, such as Koine Greek (for the last decade this has been a huge debate among Biblical scholars.) And evidentiality, which is present all around the world, including some European languages (some Slavic) was only present from what I could see in a single conlang! **If Anglocentric bias were not a factor I would expect to see conlangs with a much broader distribution of inflected TAME categories, but as it is, 80+% have tense**, maybe alongside aspect or modality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, many languages had muddled/fusional verb paradigms. You've probably seen them before: they include tense, aspect, the perfect, mood, utterance type (question or command), all in one table, each affix marking some combination of these semantic categories, but the combinations aren't very visible when they're listed one-dimensionally. Where are the agglutinative conlangs? Don't forget that European languages includes Turkish and several Uralic languages! (I found one conlang which is agglutinative in its verbal morphology: [Einodo](http://conlang.wikia.com/wiki/Einodo#Verbs).)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, often even when I judged a language to have aspect or modality it was because they had something called a &quot;conditional&quot; or a &quot;subjunctive&quot;, rather than a core division between the prototypical categories: realis/irrealis, or perfective/imperfective. Now maybe some of those languages do actually have what should be analysed as the simple core categories, but they have been given alternate names by those describing them in Wikipedia. This reflects the Eurocentric and Anglocentric bias which is a big problem in descriptive linguistics. A helpful and short book about the importance of being aware of your biases in relation to TAM categories is [*The Prominence of Tense, Aspect and Mood* by D.N.S.

It is almost not used in international context, like on the Internet (&quot;knuflo&quot; esperanto gives less than 12 results with Google), outside of groups that are community specific. Outside of these groups, the word is not understood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Knuflo is like hugging, but longer, with more parts of the body. It is like cuddling, but it is hard to describe. Users say you have to receive a *knuflo* to understand it, and you have to experience it to understand why the word is needed in the language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So here, you have three factors. People sharing the same factor tend to speak together. When people speak mainly within their own community, slang appear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Age** factor: Young people coin new words for the **new environment**, and for **concepts that are felt important for the social group**. It is exactly the same in Esperanto. But there is no clear barrier. Here is a [footage of an older person using the word &quot;knuflo&quot;](https://youtu.be/GwHvknlfV-k?t=4m15s).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Location** factor: Not all Esperanto-speakers participate regularly in Esperanto events, in fact only a minority do. There is an **event-slang**, with words such as &quot;gufujo&quot;, &quot;stelo (mono)&quot;, etc. Esperanto events are often attended by people from neighboring countries. This way local slang is shared among people of different countries and age. Because of this, you can sometimes hear &quot;knuflo&quot; in French-speaking Belgium and Germany (near the Netherlands). The word is also shared in huge international youth events like JES and IJK, where a consequent number of participants come from the knuflo-region.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Language** factor: &quot;knuflo&quot; comes directly from the Dutch verb &quot;knuffelen&quot;. Dutch-speaking beginners who are not aware of similar words like &quot;brakumo&quot; &quot;kareso&quot; &quot;dorlotado&quot; are more likely to remember and understand &quot;knuflo&quot;. This kind of **beginner-slang** tend to not go outside the local club, but &quot;knuflo&quot; is an odd exception. Maybe because some local experienced speakers think it brings new meaning."

The society of these elves strongly values being careful, thinking things through, taking one’s time and preventing mistakes. This is not a recent development but has been that way for centuries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel that the language should somehow reflect their culture of being careful and preventing mistakes — somewhat like the Japanese language mirrors the importance of showing respect to the other party with a wide range of respectful address suffixes, respectful grammatical features and a respectful vocabulary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In what way could I implement my elves’ carefulness and mistake-preventing ideal in their language?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As requested in the comments, here is some further elaboration of what I have in mind.  &#xD;&#xA;In cultures, certain behaviour is considered acceptable, certain behaviour is considered well-mannered and other behaviour is considered rude. For example, in Germany coming straight to the point is considered the normal, accepted behaviour while giving white lies is frowned upon to different degrees leading to Germans outright stating what they observe even in other languages in what is elsewhere considered an unfriendly manner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand in China, not being able to provide an answer to a question is considered rude so accepted behaviour instead is to provide an answer even if one has no idea if it is true or not.

On the other hand, providing someone with a flawed product or a not fully thought-through piece of advice would considered disrespectful because one should have taken the time to ensure the error within does not exist. (Such behaviour would be entirely unacceptable in Germany where it is expected for the finished product to arrive five minutes before the deadline.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of common — to them — proverbs would underline this expectation. Maybe something along the lines of ‘the time you lose from a bad result outweighs the gain from finishing quickly’ or ‘even the king will gladly wait for his crown’ etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope I have made the general idea more clear."

It claims to be the result of the evolution of the [Hittite language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language), after mixing with other languages in the region surrounding Asia Minor. These languages (notably Persian, Arabic, and Greek) mainly contributed loanwords, which were then modified and incorporated. Unfortunately, little information is given, and there's no substantial vocabulary list. The only supposedly &quot;Greek&quot; word given is *adelphotés*, which - matching sentences word for word - seems to have been turned into *elelpulush*. I haven't been able to determine its meaning or origin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some notes on Eressilian:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The Hittite language was an [Anatolian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_languages), which may or may not be &quot;daughter languages&quot; in the [Indo-European family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages). A competing hypothesis is that it is instead a sister language family, developing separately, rather than a branch.&#xD;&#xA; - The modern Greek language is a [Hellenic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_languages), definitely Indo-European; Persian is also Indo-European, an [Indo-Iranian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages). Arabic, on the other hand, is an [Afroasiatic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages), not Indo-European. This means that there any purely Hellenic influence will be reduced.&#xD;&#xA; - Eressilian's notable loss of [grammatical gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender) is likely a Persian influence, not Greek.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, Greek influence on Eressilian is largely only through loanwords, and is not shown in grammatical structures.

They could still use a slightly different name even incorporating the original one, e.g. &quot;_$dialect_ of _$language_&quot;, and you could do nothing about it. (For instance, _Commonmark_ initially [was called _Standard Markdown_](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/standard-markdown-is-now-commonmark/434) and was renamed after protests from the author of _Markdown_ and coiner of that term, but this happened out of courtesy not out of legal obligations, and variants with names like _Github Flavored Markdown_ or _Markdown Extra_ remain unaffected.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The **dictionary** most likely is subject to database laws which differ significantly between jurisdictions and can be rather strange. I remember a case where it was legal to read, manually type and publish a copy of a printed phone register, but the redistribution of a computer scan was prohibited.

Mostly because &quot;language concepts&quot; (e.g. tense-aspect-mood systems, animacy, verbal valence, case systems...) reflect the workings of the *human mind* far, far more than they could ever reflect the human anatomy. Anatomy/biology of course influences massive swathes of *semantics*, but I don't think anything other than pure phonetics or sign language is influenced by anatomy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Facial expressions and body language probably belong there, but tend to have a huge cultural element. Position of the ears, for example, is not something humans make (or can make) use of, but [maybe elves could][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some more semantics example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - We make distinctions useful to us *at our given size*. We cannot tell apart things by smell, or by UV light the way other animals (or measuring instruments) can. We do not tell apart very tiny things by basic names (e.g. ants, mites, sand). If we could sense, say, gravitic variations or psychic energies, we might have entirely different ways to describe position or time.&#xD;&#xA; - *Time is linear to us*, cause precedes effects and so on, we cannot watch again a past event. This obviously affects how language models time and mood. Consider the [Observers from Fringe][2] or any other species with a different perception of time. Their possibly utterly alien perception of time may well be the reason their writing is (apparently) indecipherable.&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Fish&quot; is not a proper biological class (and whether marine mammals are excluded from it in common parlance is debatable!) because we don't feel a need to be any more precise about it, but we would have better concepts for it *if we were a marine species*! Similarly, plants are divided, roughly, into, flowers, lianas, grass, trees and shrubs. This system is not even very efficient for Earth ecology!&#xD;&#xA; - Expanding on the UV thing, *color words are constrained by our visual capacity*, and typically distinguish a [surprisingly limited number of basics][3]. Forget the hierarchy part, nonderived terms usually stop around 6-8 words, why? A species with different color perception would do things differently. Mark Rosenfelder spends an entire *chapter* on this point in his *Conlanger's Lexipedia*.&#xD;&#xA; - As far as *number base systems*, decimal and vigesimal are most common in humans because we have 10 fingers, and 20 fingers and toes. (although a huge number of bases have been documented, I don't think any languages have a binary or ternary one)&#xD;&#xA; - *[Kinship terminology][4]* is based off our own reproductive biology (and our gregariousness). What of a species where the embryo must be incubated in a member of a different species? What about a species where reproduction requires gametes from more than two individuals?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://hornedfreak.tumblr.com/post/171381092902/elf-ear-communication-headcannon&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9xShALLHAU&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship_terminology" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In most languages, we have to care about these issues like when it happened and the gender of the speakers and we have to care about it in every sentence, even if it isn't otherwise topical. In English, you have to choose a gender or animacy status for a pronoun even if the distinction is irrelevant. Japanese making honorific/politeness markers obligatory is a perfect example. If I ever get around to writing a language, I plan to use this strategy, although, it only works with features that everything has.

This is all pseudo-science bunk anyhow, so you just assert that this or that feature, say through sympathetic magic makes your speakers this way or that way. German words fit together like a car engine and that is why they make such great cars. You have to form these sentences very carefully, so the people who speak the language must be very careful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the mechanics-- these show up as prefixes/affixes to nouns, adjective etc, or lexical distinctions, or a lack of lexical gaps. For example, just having a short simple word instead of needing a paragraph to discuss varieties of &quot;carefulness&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Corpus**. A language shows its culture in the corpus of text. If the language has lots of sample text that says, &quot;gosh, we are very careful people,&quot; then that is good enough.

The same goes for the symbols (alphabet) used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of these, especially the grammatical structure, would almost certainly change slightly if the users of the language were to try to make a conlang based on the language they are used to, but if the language naturally evolves, the changes I listed can be expected for roughly a thousand years of natural development (keep in mind that development would be a lot faster than is seen in modern language because there are so few people that need to update themselves)."

In most languages, we have to care about these issues like when it happened and the gender of the speakers and we have to care about it in every sentence, even if it isn't otherwise topical. In English, you have to choose a gender or animacy status for a pronoun even if the distinction is irrelevant. Japanese making honorific/politeness markers obligatory is a perfect example. If I ever get around to writing a language, I plan to use this strategy, although, it only works with features that everything has. For example, if I make &quot;edibility&quot; a necessary grammatical marker, I may have to waste a lot of air on &quot;inedible&quot; and &quot;doesn't apply&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sapir-Whorf**. This is all pseudo-science bunk anyhow, so you just assert that this or that feature, say through sympathetic magic makes your speakers this way or that way. German words fit together like a car engine and that is why they make such great cars. You have to form these sentences very carefully, so the people who speak the language must be very careful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the mechanics—these show up as prefixes/affixes to nouns, adjective etc, or lexical distinctions, or a lack of lexical gaps. For example, just having a short simple word instead of needing a paragraph to discuss varieties of &quot;carefulness&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Corpus**. A language shows its culture in the corpus of text. If the language has lots of sample text that says, &quot;gosh, we are very careful people,&quot; then that is good enough.

It's harder to invent new inflections than to drop them, and unless there is a flourishing poetry scene (perhaps to battle boredom), there wouldn't be too much reason for making word order less strict.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most languages seem to navigate a path between those extremes, but that would mean it'd just become a different language altogether.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at some real-life examples is tricky, as Latin -&gt; French/Spanish/... for example had lots of interference from other languages and external events.

The environment is fairly static, so you don't need complicated phrases to refer to things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One aspect would be communicating with the ship's computer (assuming a natural language interface) or texts.

There will still be a number of high-frequency short words that make up most of the active vocabulary. Zipf's law will still apply. The relationship between phoneme inventory and average word length will also remain: fewer phonemes will result in longer words. Short words will be more polysemous than long ones. But overall language will adapt to it's purpose, communication, in the given environment. If there are no trees, then the word _tree_ might suddenly refer to an antenna.

I talked there about the Greek influence (which is slight, from the information we have); the Hittite roots are of course much stronger. An example passage given by the creator shows Article 1 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), in Hittite and Eressilian:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Hittite&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hūmant+es antuhsa+es arawa+iya+ya annual+iya kraht(Persian)+a hoquq(Persian/Arabic) anda asanzi hassant+ke.

For instance, the Hittite &quot;antuhsa es&quot; appears similar to the Eressilian &quot;ãndushesh&quot; - both meaning, I believe, &quot;man&quot; or &quot;human&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##[Goa'uld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa%27uld#Language) (Egyptian) (sort of)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the &quot;language&quot; spoken by the Goa'uld race in [*Stargate*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate). It's ostensibly based in ancient Egyptian, drawing from the language and hieroglyphs - appropriate, given that the Goa'uld supposedly ruled Earth as gods, sometimes appearing as the gods of the ancient Egyptians. I keep seeing references to a writing variation called Nakht, which I can't find much information on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some (though not much) of the writing uses the [Meroitic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_alphabet).

Those are probably the main Meroitic contributions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All that said . . . [Goa'uld vocabulary is basically made up](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/41162/41082), and so it's not really a conlang. No attempts were made to keep much linguistic continuity, and so it's not a constructed language as such. There are probably *some* similarities to ancient Egyptian, but likely not many. I include it here only because its use of some ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs is notable; it appears that an alphabet for the language was indeed constructed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##[Irǧeret](https://forum.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?t=43643) (Egyptian and Akkadian, with Ugaritic, Arabic and Hebrew influences)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This one seems decently documented by its author. The vocabulary and phonology are derived from Egyptian, although there isn't much vocabulary listed. The organization of nouns - in number and gender - resembles Akkadian. It also contains the Akkadian declensions, with the addition of the dative. In short, the grammar and morphology appears Akkadian, while the vocabulary should be Egyptian. It's an interesting blend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##A note on [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A couple of languages have been derived from Proto-Indo-European, the reconstructed common ancestor of Indo-European languages. It's only known indirectly. Therefore, many (though not all) conlangs that are based on it also use words from more recent Indo-European languages. Proto-Indo-European is certainly antique; whether it's &quot;lesser-known&quot; is perhaps another question entirely. That said, it's not a terribly common template, and so I'm listing some Proto-Indo-European languages here for the sake of interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **[Sambahsa](http://sambahsa.pbworks.com/w/page/10183084/FrontPage%7CThe):**  [Sambahsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambahsa), an [international auxiliary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language), appears to be heavily influenced by Proto-Indo-European, primarily through vocabulary. It modifies words from languages ranging from India to Spain, attempting to go back to the languages' common roots.&#xD;&#xA; - **[Atlantean](https://web.archive.org/web/20140323053118/http://www.freewebs.com/keran_shadlag/) (Proto-Indo-European):** Like Sambahsa, [Atlantean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantean_language) is Proto-Indo-European in origin, especially when it comes to vocabulary (grammatically, it is quite different). Notably, it was created by Marc Okrand, the man behind Klingon. According to the linked website, Okrand&#xD;&#xA; &gt; took Proto-Indo-European roots and then compared them with language families at various points in time from around the world.  Where similarities between words existed, he altered the root or its semantic value to reflect that similarity.  By the combination of the PIE roots and by the adoption of new roots from these world languages, he created a vocabulary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given that these languages borrow vocabulary from many descendants of Proto-Indo-European, you could argue that they're not directly based in it. However, the intentional linguistic diversity within the family - and the attempts to base words on common similarities that are attributable to Proto-Indo-European - do seem to make these conlangs its descendants."

And, Iceland received almost no significant waves of migration prior to the recent past, so it has never had a large community of outside language learners to influence its linguistic development (just as would be the case in a generation ship).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While Iceland wasn't as isolated from other people as generation ship would be, for a period of time roughly equal to the length of a generation ship journey prior to the introduction of telecommunications, Iceland was very isolated from the rest of the world, and the vast majority of what little contact it did have with the rest of the world from visiting ships was with people who spoke the closest linguistic relative of their language in the world. So, it did not have any languages from which to borrow words, was not subject to any areal effects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Icelandic is by far the most linguistically static of the Germanic languages, with the only significant change being a change in pronunciation that arose during a several century period of Danish rule, a country that speaks a closely related by different language derived from Old Norse. A generation ship would not experience this outside influence and would not need to develop a new written language as Iceland did. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As Wikipedia explains (at the link above):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in Iceland&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from the 12th century onward, are the Icelandic Sagas. They comprise&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the historical works and the eddaic poems.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The language of the sagas is Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Norse. The Dano-Norwegian, then later Danish rule of Iceland from 1536&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic (in contrary&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to the Norwegian language), which remained in daily use among the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; general population. Though more archaic than the other living Germanic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, á, æ, au,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and y/ý).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard&#xD;&#xA;&gt; established in the 19th century, primarily by the Danish linguist&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Rasmus Rask. It is based strongly on an orthography laid out in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as The First&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Grammatical Treatise by an anonymous author, who has later been&#xD;&#xA;&gt; referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard&#xD;&#xA;&gt; was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit&#xD;&#xA;&gt; concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of k rather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than c. Various archaic features, as the letter ð, had not been used&#xD;&#xA;&gt; much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; practice. Later 20th-century changes include the use of é instead of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; je and the removal of z from the Icelandic alphabet in 1973.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Apart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; were written on vellum.

With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the original manuscripts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, usually new vocabulary is developed in response to new topics of conversation. Since the environment would change less and there would be fewer new things on a generation ship than in Iceland over the same time period (in part, due to a generation ship's lack of trade with the outside world that Iceland had) one would expect there to be less innovation in vocabulary on a generation ship than there was in Iceland.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary then, it is likely that the language of a generation ship would be extremely static over a period of approximately 1,000 years, because generally speaking it would be in conditions very similar to those of Iceland which historically has had an extremely static language over a similar time period under similar conditions. And, several of the factors that are know to have led to the modest changes between Old Icelandic and Modern Iceland over that time period would be absent on a generation ship.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For example, the dialect of Korean spoken in Korean immigrant communities in the U.S. that formed shortly after the Korean War is much more similar to the dialect spoken at the time of migration than the dialect of Korean currently spoken in South Korea, notwithstanding the fact that there have been many visits to South Korea and there has been access to modern Korean television and music in that time period in the U.S. Small, relatively isolated communities are simply much less linguistically innovative than large communities that are strongly connected to neighboring communities that speak different languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary then, it is likely that the language of a generation ship would be extremely static over a period of approximately 1,000 years, because generally speaking it would be in conditions very similar to those of Iceland which historically has had an extremely static language over a similar time period under similar conditions.

Some accelerate language change, some slow it down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Accelerating: Language is used to create identity. The firt, most important and biggest tribe are the ship's crew and passengers (if such a distinction is made). They will start to set themselves apart through names for themselves versus the planet dwellers.&lt;br&gt;Within the ship, different sub-tribes like engineers, gardeners, educators etc. will create respectively continue to develop their own slang in order to set themselves apart from other groups. The urge to set themselves apart is greater because the ship packs many people in a comparatively small space, creating a need to draw virtual borders. &#xD;&#xA; - Accelerating: Groups with lots of spare time (which I suppose our space travellers will have) generally devote some of it to developing sophisticated tastes, fads and fashions, thus creating in-groups; their language evolution is interacting with these identity functions. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to speak &quot;their slang&quot; (and wear their hair cut, and posture ...) are marked as &quot;not belonging to them&quot;. To a degree this happens in every generation of teenagers. But we can see that also on a larger scale in the development of the aristocratic French, or the fast-paced development of the politically correct speach in the United States.&#xD;&#xA; - Slowing down: There will be constant communication between all individuals of the ship through some kind of publications and messaging as well as personal conversation, given the necessary physical proximity and the need to cooperate during the mission (no group will be able to isolate themselves). This will ensure that there will continue to be a single *lingua franca*, fads and fashions not withstanding. Some people may learn and teach other languages for scientific, identity, hobby and nostalgic reasons, but they all will be competent in the main language. An important driver of the evolution of this language will be the slang of the youngsters, as always.&#xD;&#xA; - Slowing down: The generation ship will probably communicate via radio with the planet they came from; but most communication will be internal, partly because after a while communication with the home planet will not be real-time any more. The generation ship will form an isolated, small communitiy. Such communities, like the Amish in America or the German settlers in Romania, are known to preserve customs and language longer than the bigger commnunities thy split off of. We can assume that the ship receives entertainment from the home planet, like music, movies and written prose. Thus they will keep in touch with the language on the home planet; whether that ongoing contact is sufficient to keep the language on board from running its own course I don't know."

Text="**Anglish** is neither invented language nor relex nor just a casual / funny &quot;style&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is, more than anything else, a *register*. The [**Cambridge Dictionary**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/types-of-english-formal-informal-etc/register) says of register: *We use the term ‘register’ to refer to particular varieties or styles of speaking and writing. Registers vary because the language is used for different purposes, in different contexts and for different audiences. For example, there is a legal register, a register of advertising, registers of banking and a register of weather forecasting. We commonly recognise registers because of their specialised vocabulary but also because of particular uses of grammar.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much like how we have registers for differing social contexts (&quot;street talk&quot; or &quot;formal gatherings&quot; or &quot;liturgical worship&quot;), Anglish is simply another register. In this case, I'd argue that the social context is one of distinct national identity vs worldwide loss of identity. Anglish is clearly a distinct variety or style of English --- it is *English* pure and simple! --- and it is used for the particular purpose of distinguishing English English (*Our English*) from World English (*Everyone's English*).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [**Anglish Moot**](http://anglish.wikia.com/wiki/What_is_Anglish%3F) goes into some detail here. *The Anglish/New English project is intended as a means of recovering the Englishness of English and of restoring ownership of the language to the English people.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In linguistics, a [**register**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)) is simply a &quot;variety of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.&quot; In the case of Anglish, the purpose is as stated: to communicate using a *restored &amp; nativising* form of English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an artifact, it can't really be called an *invented language*, because it isn't really a thing &quot;invented&quot;. And certainly not in the usually understood sense of the concept of an invented language. For it is already *English*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's not a [**relex**](http://www.frathwiki.com/Conlang_terminology#Descriptive_terms_for_conlangs) in the conlinguistic sense because it is not a matter of &quot;making up new words&quot; and replacing the English words one for one. (In the [linguistic sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relexification), perhaps.) Anglish is a matter, simply, of bringing actual English words, older words, dialect words, disused words to the forefront along with some loan borrowing and calquing from other Germanic languages. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My vote is still for Anglish to be classified a **Register of English**."

There are two extreme possibilities. I would expect the real situation to be somewhere in between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One extreme happens when the population of the generation ship just speaks a random language, or several. And when it either does not bring a large library or somehow manages to lose or forget it (e.g. due to religious extremism).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case there will be natural language change. Here are some things that fuel language change:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The desire of a younger generation to assert their identity linguistically gives rise to youth language. As they grow older, part of their youth language becomes standard.&#xD;&#xA; - Unstressed syllables are pronounced less and less carefully, giving rise to phonetic changes. E.g., several distinctive vowels may merge into a single neutral vowel when unstressed. Vowels or consonants may even get lost.&#xD;&#xA; - The desire to express ourselves drastically in certain situation gives rise to new rules of grammar. E.g., this is how the future tense and the progressive aspect in English arose. (Neither existed in Proto-Germanic.)&#xD;&#xA; - As a word or expression is used increasingly in a specific sense, sometimes it is no longer appropriate to use it in its original sense. This drift of meaning then creates a gap that will likely be filled by a new word or expression or by initiating a similar process for another, existing one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these factors exist on a generation ship. As ohwilleke pointed out, two other factors - changing environment and contact with other languages (which also evolve) do not exist on a generation ship. (At least in the long run. Of course the first few generations will adapt their vocabulary and probably even grammar to the unique situation. E.g., some Australian languages use compass directions or geographical directions w.r.t. a specific valley instead of left and right. Something equivalent would make even more sense on a generation ship.) Therefore we can expect this language change to be really slow. Ohwilleke's example of Iceland gives us an idea of what to expect. If the ship's population starts with English, then after 1000 years they have a good chance to understand today's English to some extent. (To a greater extent if they continue reading books in today's English.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since, realistically, a generation ship to Alpha Centauri would be travelling for many thousand years, without further stabilising factors we can expect that they would arrive speaking a language that is at most vaguely similar to the one they started with. I would not expect this language to have unusual features compared to languages currently spoken on Earth. There might, however, be some grammatical structures related to the special situation on the ship. And there might also be a large number of regularities, as is often the case for languages of small speaker communities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A generation ship will probably bring a large library. However, if the population had unrestricted access to it, this might lead to a society that basically lives in the past and will be unable to settle a new planet. But in any case I would expect that some people on board continue to learn Earth languages so they can understand part of that library. Depending on the precise circumstances, this could be a stabilising factor or even fuel language change due to different Earth languages being fashionable at different times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A civilisation that wants to control the language spoken by the settlers of a distant planet will have to turn linguistics from a descriptive science into a field of engineering. They may be able to create a language that is a lot more stable than any naturally occurring language. This doesn't mean there is no change at all, but it means that significant change is normally cyclic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Language change is already largely cyclic in terms of high-level features of languages. E.g., if a language does not have a past tense, then a composite tense like present perfect will likely come up to fill this gap. The auxiliaries will then merge with the verbs that carry the meaning, becoming suffixes or prefixes. They will slowly lose stress, become unrecognisable as auxiliaries, become indistinguishable from each other and finally will disappear, so that the language again doesn't have a past tense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an isolated speaker community, it might be possible to come up with a language A such that after one such cycle a language B results that is mutually intelligible with A to a strong degree. Now the speakers of B will likely read a lot of the literary output of the speakers of A, leading to further stabilisation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note: I arrived at these last thoughts from a different angle. In the extreme case, success of an international language such as Esperanto would mean that everybody in the world speaks Esperanto and only Esperanto. But this is not a stable situation, at least not with an essentially random language such as Esperanto. So I thought about whether there can be a language that would remain the only language spoken on Earth once it managed to get to that point." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

First, some general numbers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over 1000 years, Old High German split into the various southern German dialects, including Swiss German and Standard German. While differences are very noticable, many developments were parallel and speakers usually don’t take long to get accustomed to the differences. A similar time depth can be claimed for English vs Scots. Old High German itself is not readily intelligible to the modern speaker, but many words are recognizable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2000 years ago, we had Latin and Proto-Germanic, the ancestors of the Romance and Germanic branches of Indo-European. While the modern languages all show clear similarities in most regards of the language, they are as a general rule not mutually intelligible and speakers need to invest a lot of time to learn another of those languages - but still much less than with an unrelated language. Proto-Germanic and Latin are both quite different than the modern languages, showing vast differences in morphology and syntax, as well as having undergone many sound changes since. Nevertheless, with some knowledge on etymology, words can readily be recognized for what they are in a written text. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;About 4000-6000 years ago, we have PIE. At this point, the language is no longer immediately recognizable as being related to a modern European language. The grammar is very different - just as an example, PIE verbs inflect for three persons and three numbers, but not directly for tense or aspect, which are instead marked with various more-or-less productive derivational affixes. The phonology would also look very out of place in modern day Europe. And for most roots, even if they didn’t change much phonologically, there was probably a semantic shift somewhere between PIE and English. The average English speaker will understand exactly zero words in a passage in Serbian or Punjabi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But there’s another side to this as well. General tendencies are fine, but what about individual languages? If you compare Italian and French to Latin, then it’s plainly obvious that French has changed more, at least with regards to phonology and morphology. Similarly, comparing English to Icelandic, the latter is clearly more conservative (though no where near as much as some people might make you believe). To me, French and English look like they are 500+ years further in the future than their contemporary siblings — in reality of course they just underwent some more drastical sound changes that in turn messed with their morphology, which in turn forced changes to the syntax. People try to ascribe those changes to various factors, usually external ones such as a large number of foreign learners, but most of this is not grounded in actual science and just speculation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As such, no definitive answer can be given. I find the time depths I gave above to be good rules of thumb, but single languages may deviate from those quite a bit. To achieve such results, it’s important to apply changes not only to the phonology, but to all parts of the language — especially the lexicon." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So in the sentence “Before returning home, he had gone shopping”, the topic time would be the moment of arriving home, and the eventuality time the time of going shopping, and the English past perfect marks that the latter happened before the former.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A logical extension of this system then would be to not only mark for differences in topic and eventuality _time_, but also topic and eventuality _space_. In the above sentence, the topic space (or location) would be the home, while the location of the shopping would be the eventuality space. The sentence might then mark for the fact that the shopping center is far away from the home, as opposed to (for example), inside the home. Further distinctions could be made with regards to motion: shopping is fairly stationary, but in “To get home, he had to drive on the highway”, there is clear motion towards the topic space and this too might be marked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I am curious, does anything along these lines exist in natural languages?

The Nimboran languages in particular have highly complex systems e.g. [Wilden(1976)][1] describes Kemtuk as having the following system: https://i.imgur.com/cYKT8xS.png, but says that it is optional.  [Anceaux (1965)][2] describes 16 different spatial categories in Nimboran proper, but in a rather unhelpful manner. He notes that the unmarked position category, when the speaker is involved has a specific meaning of &quot;near the speaker&quot;, but that it is also always used when the speakers position is indefinite or irrelevant, such as in stories or general statements. In at least some languages I have looked at, these markers were compulsory with motion verbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A somewhat different system involving location relative to other events is described by [Huisman (1973)][3] who reports that Angaataha has a class of medial verbs which are inflected for whether they occur in the same place or in a different place as the following conjunct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as I can tell, none of this completely satisfies your request, but it shows that at least some things are definitely attested, and distinguish other, or more fine categories than what you've found yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://papuaweb.org/dlib/irian/5-2.PDF&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&amp;docid=613375&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ling.1973.11.issue-110/ling.1973.11.110.43/ling.1973.11.110.43.xml" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Here are some things that fuel language change:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The desire of a younger generation to assert their identity linguistically gives rise to youth language.

E.g., several distinctive vowels may merge into a single neutral vowel when unstressed. Vowels or consonants may even get lost.&#xD;&#xA; - The desire to express ourselves drastically in certain situation gives rise to new rules of grammar. E.g., this is how the future tense and the progressive aspect in English arose. (Neither existed in Proto-Germanic.)&#xD;&#xA; - As a word or expression is used increasingly in a specific sense, sometimes it is no longer appropriate to use it in its original sense. This drift of meaning then creates a gap that will likely be filled by a new word or expression or by initiating a similar process for another, existing one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these factors exist on a generation ship. As ohwilleke pointed out, two other factors - changing environment and contact with other languages (which also evolve) do not exist on a generation ship. (At least in the long run. Of course the first few generations will adapt their vocabulary and probably even grammar to the unique situation. E.g., some Australian languages use compass directions or geographical directions w.r.t. a specific valley instead of left and right. Something equivalent would make even more sense on a generation ship.) Therefore we can expect this language change to be really slow. Ohwilleke's example of Iceland gives us an idea of what to expect. If the ship's population starts with English, then after 1000 years they have a good chance to understand today's English to some extent. (To a greater extent if they continue reading books in today's English.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since, realistically, a generation ship to Alpha Centauri would be travelling for many thousands of years, without further stabilising factors we can expect that they would arrive speaking a language that is at most vaguely similar to the one they started with. I would not expect this language to have unusual features compared to languages currently spoken on Earth. There might, however, be some grammatical structures related to the special situation on the ship. And there might also be a large number of irregularities, as is often the case for languages of small speaker communities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A generation ship will probably bring a large library. However, if the population had unrestricted access to it, this might lead to a society that basically lives in the past and will be unable to settle a new planet. But in any case I would expect that some people on board continue to learn Earth languages so they can understand part of that library. Depending on the precise circumstances, this could be a stabilising factor or even fuel language change due to different Earth languages being fashionable at different times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A civilisation that wants to control the language spoken by the settlers of a distant planet will have to turn linguistics from a descriptive science into a field of engineering. They may be able to create a language that is a lot more stable than any naturally occurring language. This doesn't mean there is no change at all, but it means that significant change is normally cyclic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Language change is already largely cyclic in terms of high-level features of languages. E.g., if a language does not have a past tense, then a composite tense like present perfect will likely come up to fill this gap. The auxiliaries will then merge with the verbs that carry the meaning, becoming suffixes or prefixes. They will slowly lose stress, become unrecognisable as auxiliaries, become indistinguishable from each other and finally will disappear, so that the language again doesn't have a past tense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an isolated speaker community, it might be possible to come up with a language A such that after one such cycle a language B results that is mutually intelligible with A to a strong degree. Now the speakers of B will likely read a lot of the literary output of the speakers of A, leading to further stabilisation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note: I arrived at these last thoughts from a different angle. In the extreme case, success of an international language such as Esperanto would mean that everybody in the world speaks Esperanto and only Esperanto. But this is not a stable situation, at least not with an essentially random language such as Esperanto.

Say half a dozen such languages. By providing an extensive and stimulating library in all of these languages, it could be possible to make language evolution essentially cyclic throughout the flight, so that at the end everyone will be speaking a variation of one of the library languages (possibly an intermediate stage). But it also seems likely that this would lead to a multilingual situation (with several library languages spoken simultaneously), so that one would also have to consider contact effects between these languages.

He was also interested in many languages outside his&#xD;&#xA;&gt; field and developed a particular love for the Finnish language (he&#xD;&#xA;&gt; described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as &quot;entering a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and flavour never tasted before&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Finnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; part gave rise to Quenya.

Numerous&#xD;&#xA;&gt; words were borrowed from existing languages, but less and less&#xD;&#xA;&gt; obviously as Tolkien progressed. Words that are an exact match with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; existing Welsh words can be found in the early drafts of Tolkien’s&#xD;&#xA;&gt; manuscripts published as The History of Middle-earth,[4] but attempts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works&#xD;&#xA;&gt; published during his lifetime are often very dubious.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: [Languages (Tolkien Gateway)][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Languages" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I’ll show in what ways history can manifest with a bunch of examples from different areas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Orthography**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Almost no language with a history of writing has a fully regular orthography. Even if there are regular writing reforms, some aspects of the orthography will just be considered “part of it” and stick. English is of course a very extreme example of this, but you don’t need to take it that far. German for example generally has a rather regular orthography. But the digraph ⟨ie⟩ represents a long /iː/, reflecting that in the past (and in some dialects until the present) there was a diphthong /iə/ in German, which became to be pronounced that way. It also has two separate graphemes for the phonemes /ɛ eː/, namely ⟨e ä⟩, reflecting whether the sound originates from a fronted /a aː/ or not. On top of this, there are some segments which have unpredictable pronunciation: word final -ig for example is pronounced /ɪç/ instead of expected /ɪk/. In short, unless your writing system was designed very recently by linguists, it likely shows leftovers from the past. In the most extreme cases, writing systems can lag behind centuries (English, French, Tibetan), but even if they don’t they can preserve some old features.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Morphology**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most languages with inflections show some degree of irregularity among them. This can manifest in many degrees, from almost entirely regular (Swahili has only one class of six slightly irregular verbs, one of which is suppletive in the present tense) to a basically complete lack of predictability ([Navajo verb stems][navajo] have defied any attempts to find rules for their inflections thus far. There don’t seem to be distinct paradigms, every verb does its own thing!). However, these irregularities are not random. To show what I mean, compare these two sets of declensions. The first two are latin singular nouns (in an less traditional order), the second two made up on the spot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    NOM filius rēx      kwero   tulya   &#xD;&#xA;    VOC filiī  rēx      kwerap  tulte&#xD;&#xA;    ACC filium rēgem    kweruf  tultsu&#xD;&#xA;    GEN filiī  rēgis    kwerim  tulne&#xD;&#xA;    DAT filiō  rēgī     kwerx   tulum&#xD;&#xA;    ABL filiō  rēge     kwert   tulwo&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two things should stick out: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The Latin forms of rēx show two distinct stems, those ending in /k/ (rēx, where the spelling hides the fact that really it’s rēc-s) and those ending in /g/ (all other forms). Looking a bit closer, we can see that the /g/ appears exactly before those forms with a vowel in the suffix. Intervocalic voicing (which accounts for /k/ becoming /g/) is a common sound change and applies here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. While in both languages, some of the affixes seem to be unrelated, there are still patterns: nominative takes -s, accusative takes -m, genitive has an -i in the suffix… If we added other paradigms into the comparison, even more such patterns would arise, indicating that they really originate from a much more regular system that got changed up over time by various factors like sound changes. In the made up language, on the other hand, the affixes are entirely random, and this causes the irregularity to look more unnatural than if everything took the same affixes.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA;**Phonology**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider the [Japanese consonant inventory][japanese]. It looks something like this (omitting allophones):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      m |   n |   ɴ |&#xD;&#xA;    p b | t d | k g |&#xD;&#xA;        | s z |     | h&#xD;&#xA;        |   r |     |&#xD;&#xA;        |   j |   w |&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;What this table does not show however is that /p/ is significantly rarer than /t k/. Why would that be? Simply because many instances of that sound somewhat recently shifted to what is /h/ in modern Japanese. In other words, a sound change caused a significant imbalance in the distribution of sounds. If one were to simply generate words with a word generator, not paying attention to the history of the language, all sounds would show up with similar frequency. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Vocabulary**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I give you any word, you can probably find several alternative ways of expressing that meaning. “big”, “tall”, “large”, “spacious”, “gigantic”… they all have different connotations, sure, but in the end they’re all descriptions for roughly the same thing - objects which take up a big fraction of your field of view when near them. Meanwhile, many conlangs will have a dictionary entry like **gwop** _adj_ “big” and that’s it. Adding synonyms, especially ones with subtly different meanings allows you to greatly affect the way texts read (in a positive way). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the same time however, often complicated words are derived from simpler concepts. This naturally has the effect of making them longer, causing a variation in the lengths of words - many short words with a few longer ones in-between is a common pattern. But if you simply create a new root every time you make a word, you won’t get that - and your hypothetical speakers will have to remember every single word without help, even ones they barely ever use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I could go on and on and list things in every category of linguistics I can think of, but in the end it all boils down to this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Irregularity in languages either preserves older, then-regular systems in now untransparent ways (English verbs are another great case study for this) or are the creation of sound change messing with regularity. The former is the reason why common words tend to be less regular - if you commonly hear a word it’s easier to preserve its original form and remember the irregularity once it has arisen. In the case of Navajo I mentioned above, curiously it seems to be that first sound change caused irregularity, and then the native speakers applying analogy caused the whole system to become even more irregular. See the paper I linked above for some hypotheses on how that worked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, onto the actual question: Assume you have a conlang already, and it lacks history and is entirely too regular. “Sterile”, one might say. What can you do? I’d like to present you two options:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Invent a history for your language. Sketch out how your verbal system may have looked in the past and see if you can lead that to some interesting irregular forms or alterations. Come up with some sound changes that may have led to the current state of the language. You don’t have to do this in great detail, but obviously (as always with conlangs) the more effort you put in, the better it will look.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Make your language the history. If you don’t mind your end result potentially looking vastly different from what you have now, you can decide to move the  current state of the language into the past. You may have to make some changes to vocabulary to keep it in line with technology, but otherwise there’s not really any difference between a modern language and a “proto-language”. Then, you can track its changes through history in great detail, and in doing so introduce its natural flavour. No one has to know that the proto-language you worked from was unnaturalistic (but you’ll have to live with that knowledge. Just remember that you have to start _somewhere_, you can’t derive every conlang from the first utterances of mankind). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a footnote, I’d like to make a book recommendation: [The Unfolding of Language][book] by Guy Deutscher. In this book, Deutscher discusses (in a very accessible manner) exactly what this question boils down to: how and why did languages become the way they are - messy and irregular and oh so complicated. I believe every conlanger should read this book, regardless of level of experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[navajo]: http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/eddingtond/navajo.pdf&#xD;&#xA;[japanese]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Consonants&#xD;&#xA;[book]: https://www.amazon.com/Unfolding-Language-Evolutionary-Mankinds-Invention/dp/0805080120" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Just like we refer to &quot;folders&quot; and &quot;files&quot; on a computer or speak about &quot;surfing&quot; the &quot;net&quot; (using older terms to metaphorically refer to newer things that needed terms), generation ship colonists newly landed on a planet might refer to a land vehicle as a &quot;shuttlecraft&quot; or &quot;capsule&quot;, call their political leader a &quot;captain&quot;, or refer to the death penalty as &quot;being thrown out of an airlock&quot; (even if the actual means of execution becomes something else).

Our colonists might rediscover physical message boards but refer to posting notes on them as &quot;uploading&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There could be a wider cultural effect too that expands to include both linguistic and non-linguistic features. If colonists are used to a shipboard timekeeping system that is detached from astronomical phenomena, or that is based on astronomical phenomena only visible from elsewhere in the universe, they might continue using it after landing on a planet despite the presence of astronomical phenomena that could be used to construct a calendar. Consider how the Apollo astronauts on the Moon continued to use Earth-based timekeeping metrics even though they could have adopted some sort of &quot;Moon time&quot; based on the cycle of the Lunar day and/or the apparent rotation of Earth in the sky. This sort of phenomenon could cause holidays to &quot;rotate&quot; throughout the seasons of the new homeworld in a similar way that dates defined in Earth-based lunar calendars (e.g. Ramadan) can occur in any solar season. Perhaps the new colony world has a year that is half that of Earth, so Christmas now comes every *other* northern hemisphere winter, or the year is twice as long as Earth's, so the colonists celebrate Christmas at the beginning of winter and again at the beginning of summer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See Robert Heinlein's *Orphans of the Sky* for some examples of how this might look."

Though they're all based on spoken languages. All the 'speaker' does is mimic the tonal pattern without pronouncing any phonemes. Such languages are used by hunters to communicate without alerting their quarry, because the language sounds just like bird song. But they don't use this language for most day-to-day communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for a pikachu, well their 'words' are made up of three possible syllables: pi, ka, and chu. Thus a pikachu would have a total of 3 possible one-syllable words, 9 two-syllable words, and 27 three-syllable words. As we see, words would need to get quite long to get the possible vocabulary up to 100. Using tones though would easily multiply this. Even a simple two-tone system would double the number of possible syllables. Thus the syllable count would be 6 one-syllable words, 36 two-syllable words, and 216 three-syllable words. And there are real languages that have as many as 6 tones. With such a system, a pikachu would have 18 possible syllables to work with. Of course, you could say pokemon are more sensitive to tone than humans, which could increase the number of tones beyond what any human could manage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though a problem arises with cross-species communication. Obviously, no two species have the same set of syllables. Thus, for different species to be able to communicate with each other, the poke-language would probably have to be purely tonal, like a whistled language. Though you could 'multiply' the number of tones using length. A tone held for a short time could be considered a separate 'phoneme' from the same tone held longer. But we might just be fooling ourselves. The pokemon may just see a long tone as two identical tones right next to each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most pokemon of course aren't intelligent enough to warrant a full-fledged language. Even Toki Pona would like contain some words they wouldn't make use of. Yeah, there's things like Alakazam which have an IQ higher than humans, but of course they can communicate telepathically, which would completely remove their need to use a language. And of course, there's some that can learn human language. Team Rocket's Meowth not only can speak, but he even taught himself how to! There's also one of the early movies which features a talking slowking. And one episode of the anime has a tenacool possessing meowth and speaking through him, which would imply it knows and understands human language, but lacks the ability to actually produce human sounds. Though honestly, its astounding that any pokemon could pronounce a human language. We have a lot of features in our mouths unique to our species that allow us to talk. Some birds in the real world can mimic human speech, but they accomplish this differently from how we do. I believe there is a pokemon in one of the later generations that can mimic human speech, though it can't understand language. By the way, the franchise is quite inconsistent as to whether pokemon can understand spoken speech or not." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Most of the professional conlangers you've heard of got their first conlanging job because they were very, very lucky and got any subsequent conlanging jobs because of their first one.

Wardesan, Láadan, Tolkien's books are good examples. I'm guessing the conlang part though is reducing their income, they could write more books if they skipped writing a conlang. Personally, I'd buy a book with a conlang if the author tried to make it simple enough to enjoy for 10 to 20 hours. Instead we get unusable languages that require 2000 hours of study to appreciate them, same or worse than a natural language. And I'm an outlier, so I'd imagine regular genre fiction buyers see a bundled language as a low value gimmick. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Communication Systems for the Disabled**.&#xD;&#xA;Blissymbols made money, albeit in a rather dishonorable way by suing the institution that was trying to help the profoundly disabled communicate with a symbol board, which was in essence an artificial language. I spoke with a specialist in the more modern versions of these, and often vendors don't even bother to acknowledge that symbol boards are not English, but conlang-like systems with all the challenges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the realm of conscripts, there is a commercial writing system for ASL. I'm failing to re-find the link.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Historical BSL was essentially a franchise and BSL was something of a trade secret.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Movies.**&#xD;&#xA;Movies have been hiring professional linguists (Klingon, Na'vi) The Klingon dictionary and Avatar handbook sold a lot of copies, but the authors both became professional linguists first, and these books are really side projects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Selling learning materials.**&#xD;&#xA;This has got to be the worst way to monetize a conlang. The artificial language section of any large library has to be littered with books of people who thought they could sell a lot of copies of their grammar summaries, workbooks and dictionaries. No one wants the grammar summary. What they want is to meet their significant other by learning a language which brings me to...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto**&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto actually has economic activity, but the language is already written. Building a language starts with grammar and vocabulary, but to extract money from people, people need to learn it. If your interest in conlang building is in the community building part, then it might make more sense to make a living working with an existing conlang that has attracted a community, complete with conferences, etc. That said, I'm guessing no one is getting rich off of Esperanto, but there are teachers of Esperanto, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Games**&#xD;&#xA;There have been reports of people writing full languages for computer games, card games. Magic the Gathering's Phyrexian comes to mind. So far, these have been gimmicks and the amount of money, I'm guessing is not a lot.

Some accelerate language change, some slow it down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Accelerating: Language is used to create identity. The first, most important and biggest tribe are the ship's crew and passengers (if such a distinction is made). They will start to set themselves apart through names for themselves versus the planet dwellers.&lt;br&gt;Within the ship, different sub-tribes like engineers, gardeners, educators etc. will create respectively continue to develop their own slang in order to set themselves apart from other groups. The urge to set themselves apart is greater because the ship packs many people in a comparatively small space, creating a need to draw virtual borders. &#xD;&#xA; - Accelerating: Groups with lots of spare time (which I suppose our space travelers will have) generally devote some of it to developing sophisticated tastes, fads and fashions, thus creating in-groups; their language evolution is interacting with these identity functions. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to speak &quot;their slang&quot; (and wear their hair cut, and posture ...) are marked as &quot;not belonging to them&quot;. To a degree this happens in every generation of teenagers. But we can see that also on a larger scale in the development of the aristocratic French, or the fast-paced development of the politically correct speech in the United States.&#xD;&#xA; - Slowing down: There will be constant communication between all individuals of the ship through some kind of publications and messaging as well as personal conversation, given the necessary physical proximity and the need to cooperate during the mission (no group will be able to isolate themselves). This will ensure that there will continue to be a single *lingua franca*, fads and fashions not withstanding. Some people may learn and teach other languages for scientific, identity, hobby and nostalgic reasons, but they all will be competent in the main language. An important driver of the evolution of this language will be the slang of the youngsters, as always.&#xD;&#xA; - Slowing down: The generation ship will probably communicate via radio with the planet they came from; but most communication will be internal, partly because after a while communication with the home planet will not be real-time any more. The generation ship will form an isolated, small community. Such communities, like the Amish in America or the German settlers in Romania, are known to preserve customs and language longer than the bigger communities thy split off of. We can assume that the ship receives entertainment from the home planet, like music, movies and written prose. Thus they will keep in touch with the language on the home planet; whether that ongoing contact is sufficient to keep the language on board from running its own course I don't know."

However, Okrand is still the only person who can introduce new words into the Klingon language, which is maintained by the Klingon Language Institute.

The basic English grammar still remained Anglo-Saxon (as the majority of the population spoke it), and the main influence of Norman French (the powerful but small elite) was in the vocabulary. There are a few instances (eg putting some specific adjectives after the noun, as in _president elect_ or _times past_) where French structures were adopted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would think that vocabulary is more a conscious choice, and Norman power made people adopt French words, but the grammatical structures being more sub-conscious meant that they were harder to change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue is how closely related the origin languages are. Obviously, while Norman French and Old English are different families, they both share the Indo-European ancestry, so are not that radically different. Compare that to, eg the Philippines, where there is a great language variety, and Asian/Polynesian languages clashed with Spanish/English in the colonial period. Here is one creole, [Chavacano][1], which apparently has mostly Spanish vocabulary (so that it is classed as a Romance language), but _their grammatical structures are generally similar to other Philippine languages_ (Wikipedia).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it seems that power drives the vocabulary, but quantity of speakers determines the grammar. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavacano" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

But according to the [Elvish Linguistic Fellowship](http://www.elvish.org/), an organization dedicated to the study of Tolkien's invented languages, even Quenya and Sindarin are simply not learnable:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The vocabulary, grammar, and syntax of Tolkien's invented languages, even of Quenya and Sindarin, **are far too incomplete to allow its casual, conversational, or quotidian use**. As Tolkien himself stated, &quot;It should be obvious that if it is possible to compose fragments of verse in Quenya and Sindarin, those languages (and their relations one to another) must have reached a fairly high degree of organization — though of course, far from completeness, either in vocabulary, or in idiom&quot; (Letters p. 380). Indeed, it was never Tolkien's intent to make Quenya, Sindarin, or any of his languages into spoken, written, auxiliary, or otherwise &quot;useful&quot; forms; rather, they were done for purely personal enjoyment. As Tolkien wrote, &quot;It must be emphasized that this process of invention was/is a private enterprise undertaken to give pleasure to myself by giving expression to my personal linguistic 'aesthetic' or taste and its fluctuations&quot; (ibid.)    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-- [the aforementioned E.L.F.'s FAQ](http://www.elvish.org/FAQ.html), emphasis mine&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An article entitled [&quot;Elvish As She Is Spoke&quot;](http://www.elvish.org/articles/EASIS.pdf) goes into more depth about the history of Tolkien's Elvish and the problems with trying to learn to speak it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;But don't they speak Elvish in the films?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The lines and lyrics from Tolkien's languages in the Peter Jackson films were written by [David Salo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Salo), a linguist who wrote [a grammar of Sindarin](https://www.amazon.com/Gateway-Sindarin-Grammar-Language-Tolkiens/dp/0874808006/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523838282&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=0874808006&amp;dpID=515k5%252BqqkFL&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch). He built the dialogue he needed on the limited available attested vocabulary, coining some new words himself but with the goal of making it intelligible to any viewers familiar with Tolkien's languages. [To quote him](http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_intro.htm):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Why is there Elvish in the movie? Why did Peter Jackson care enough to strive for some accuracy in the way language is presented? (...) The Elvish in the movie is addressed to the minority of viewers who know something about the languages. And what are they going to want to do when they hear the Elvish sentences?  They're going to want to figure out what they mean, and *why* they mean what they mean. Part of *my* intention, my particular vision and contribution to this movie, was to create sentences which would be intelligible to the people who study the languages (...) I'm enormously happy to see some people saying based on their knowledge of Elvish, great or small, that they recognized and understood some of what they heard on the screen. That's great - that's *exactly* the kind of effect that I was looking for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is [a collection of the translated dialogue from the LoTR films](http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_elvish.htm), with the attested and unattested vocabulary in each line listed. As you can see, a lot of it is attested in Tolkien's works, but there is quite a bit that needed to be invented for the film by Salo. There have been other projects based on Tolkien's Elvish languages in the past as well, but the real fanatics tend to view these as &quot;pseudo-Elvish&quot;, since anything not invented by Tolkien can't really be said to be part of Tolkien's Elvish. That said, there's nothing wrong with seeking out resources for and learning these expansions on Tolkien's conlangs -- just know that calling any one an authentic recreation of Tolkien's Elvish is pretty flawed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tl;dr&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  Since Tolkien never fixed his languages firmly or described them completely enough to provide any such comprehensive and corrective model (that never being his goal), ... it is consequently a further inescapable fact that no one has or ever will be able to speak Quenya and Sindarin, any more than anyone will ever (again) be able to speak, say, Etruscan or any other fragmentarily-attested non-living language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look into [the E.L.F.'s resources](http://www.elvish.org/resources.html) (though they do seem a tad outdated) if you're interested in further exploring what information we have about Tolkien's Elvish."

In toki pona you can write the words in a set of pictograms (actually, there are several pictogrammatic writing systems, I'm referring here to the 'hieroglyphs' from the official book). As there are only 120 words, it's easy to have pictograms for all of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only problem is what happens with **other** words. Names, for example. The toki pona solution is to select a hieroglyph whose word starts with the respective sound. This leaves some choice, as you typically have several pictograms available and you can choose a word whose meaning is somewhat relevant to the name. For example, _Kanata_ (Canada) could start with the pictogram for _kasi_ (&quot;plant, leaf&quot;), to link to the maple leaf; _Nokisi_ (Norway) would start with _nena_ (&quot;hill, mountain&quot;), etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here you are using pictograms to **spell** a word, but it is easily conceivable to have a separate script for names and foreign words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the vocabulary of your language is substantially larger than toki pona's 120 words, you might not want to use pictograms for everything. In this case you could use them either for 'core' words (whether you define them by meaning, age,  etymology or frequency), or it could be words that have no inflections (and thus don't change, eg function words like _and_ and _for_ in English).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end it's your choice how you solve this, but there are certainly some possible justifications for different choices that you could explore."

That is, consider these four possible types of grammar rules (they may be other rules a language may follow):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **A pronoun always refers to the last referent**, any mention of a prior referent must be renamed. So in your example, the grammar would remove the ambiguity as such a rule would refer to James in your original example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And if Adam was the intent, then it would need to be one of these:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adam sent the essay to James to help Adam with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To James, Adam sent the essay to help him with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **A pronoun always refers to the far referent when two referents are in view**, and is left off when the near referent is intended. So of James getting help, no pronoun is used, and the sentence would roughly translate simply as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help with writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But of Adam, the pronoun would be used:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **A pronoun always refers back to a subject**, never an object (which must be restated if intended). So of James:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adam sent the essay to James to help James with James's writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though I suspect something like #2 for James might be stated as well; or the language would form such a statement to place the main player in the subject position in a passive construction:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; James was sent an essay by Adam to help him with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For Adam, it would be as you originally stated:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. **A pronoun always refers back to an object**, never the subject (which is restated if intended). So of James it is as you already had:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But for Adam, it might be this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adam sent the essay to James to help Adam with his writing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Notice in that previous example by restating &quot;Adam&quot; as the object of &quot;to help,&quot; it then put Adam in the most recent object position and allows for the &quot;his&quot; to then refer to Adam (who was also the subject).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So for some of these grammatical ways of reducing ambiguity, the sentence structure in the language becomes more important (which may or may not be desirable in the language one is constructing)."

Text="# Length&#xD;&#xA;A few things. First, Lojban often needs longer sentences to express something than it does in, for example, English.&#xD;&#xA;# Vocabulary&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, Lojban's vocabulary isn't that big, especially in the domain of sciences. Words would have to be calqued, adapted from English, French, etc. or completely re-invented.&#xD;&#xA;# Loaning and naming&#xD;&#xA;Thirdly, the English language (and many natural languages) loans words directly (for example, *champagne* could be \*shampain and *buoy* could be *boy or *boi) without changing spelling (a slight counterexample would be German, which often changes the letter c pronounced [k] to the letter k, like *Kanada* and *Vokabular*).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lojban doesn't. *.R&lt;! Don't decapitalise the R. In Lojban, it might be smallcapped, but we don't keep that in English&gt;omas.* is Rome (Italy), *.xavanas.* is Havanas (Cuba) and *.lidz.* is Leeds (UK). This makes it confusing in some cases. How would Lojban adapt [Turra Coo][1] or people like [Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela][2]? The name should stay recognisable but pronounceable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rhetoric&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, many rhetorical devices such as these would be boring, simply boring. Shakespeare would be an ordinary novel writer, the Bible no longer so majestic and this sentence boring. Language would be unambiguous: literature boring. Language needs rhetoric, rhetoric needs language. Epizeuxis. Epizeuxis. Epizeuxis. Alliteration acts amazingly when all aposiopesis achieves is... Aposiopesis achieves... Aposiopesis... Rhetoric is not unlike magic. What would we have without rhetoric? We'd have a boring and a world. Rhetoric, her voice is beautiful, her heart full of peace and her prosopopoeia angel-like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, to finish that rant, try to translate this to Lojban.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A shocking affair occurred last night.

The surface that things are written on. Runes were carved in trees and, as such, do not have curves. The Greek alphabet was written on tablets, and curved lines were possible. The Arabic alphabet was written quickly on papyrus. Also, some civilisations might prefer cursive script over others. Arabic letters differ whether they're isolated, at the beginning of a word, at the end or in the middle. So does your handwriting with the Roman script.

The Arabic alphabet was written quickly on papyrus. Also, some civilisations might prefer cursive script over others. Arabic letters differ whether they're isolated, at the beginning of a word, at the end or in the middle. So does your handwriting with the Roman script. But Arabic kept their cursive when the digital age came, and the Roman script got rid of it and created the same character.  &#xD;&#xA;Os (runes), psi (Greek alphabet, but modernised on a computer, see footnote 1), šīn (Arabic script, isolated)&#xD;&#xA;# ᚩ, Ψ, ش&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.

Or A was an abjad (alphabet without vowels) and B1 became an alphabet whereas B2 stayed an abjad.&#xD;&#xA;3. Although language is passed on from mother language to daughter language with diachronics, script *doesn't need to*. In fact, you don't often see one script in the same language for three language-generations except in some cases like Latin (but Vulgar Latin wasn't really written much). Borrow a script from a neighbouring language. This is what I recommend doing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Footnotes: 1) Ancient Greek part of the Rosetta stone.

I think regularity would speed up learning, as children during language learning overgeneralise (see experiments with English past tense endings): and instead of learning the correct exceptions at a later stage the corresponding feature would have been learned earlier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a programme for teaching [Esperanto as a first foreign language][1], as it can be used to increase second language awareness and is supposed to make learning a natural foreign language easier. You don't have to worry about exceptions, for one thing, so you can teach the concept without having to hedge your explanations by listing all the cases where it's different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My personal view on 'difficulty' of different languages is that all languages are about equally difficult. Some languages are easier/simpler regarding some features (English inflectional morphology), but make up for that in others (vast number of near-synonyms with different distributional characteristics in English). Topi Pona is a very simple language (120 words, virtually no syntactic complexity), so you can learn it almost in a day, but it is very hard to express complicated narratives, and an equivalent text in a more complex language would be far more concise. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Learning Esperanto is reasonably easy, but then you look at how people actually use it in everyday interactions, and you find that it is more difficult than you imagined: there are a lot of the smaller particles that make it tricky to understand for a beginner. But the 'early' sentences composed when the language was still fairly new are a lot simpler. However, they were not suitable for encoding all the pragmatic and other information people need for an everyday language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, there are undoubtedly features that make it easier for children to learn a language as L1, but the question is &quot;what for?&quot; It's a bit like learning Lisp programming: understanding the syntax takes literally ten minutes, but that does not mean you can write useful programs in it after that. Languages are more than the sum of syntax and vocabulary, and if there was a language that was easier to learn and use than other languages, and had equal expressive power, then we would all be speaking it already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.esperantoresearch.org.uk/site/book/files" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In summary, the&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; conclusion that Tolkien “consciously or unconsciously achieved a literary effect in terms of Slavic culture through the prism of the Germanic”, goes too far on too little evidence [...] Better would be to say that Tolkien did indeed incorporate a few Slavic elements into the multifaceted and multi-sourced structure and background of Middle-earth, but that he did so quite sparingly and, in almost every case, only at its furthest margins.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the detailed analysis can be found in that article, it seems fairly clear that while a few words may have crept in here and there, these words were also Germanic cognates or were cut out of Tolkien's language, with only one or two exceptions."

It’s impossible for humans to produce in normal speech, as the aliens who speak Yeltax have a syrinx, which makes to base frequencies possible. (Note: I made that before I learned any phonetics, and now I think I’d want to think about the acoustics here to distinguish this from the harmonics we use for vowels.)&#xA;&#xA;In general, though, most conlangers don’t make up too many sounds. Many of the gaps in the IPA chart are physically impossible, and it’s questionable that we’ve missed a major articulator. I think most of the true inventions will be for non-human languages.&#xA;&#xA;Leaving behind sound, though, it could be said that Rikchik has a robust alien phonetics that was invented from scratch.

But after this time, it might be said that, divorced of all real connexion with French or Anglo-French culture, Law French came to be something like an invented language *based on* natural French. It was certainly a group project (lawyers and judges, all others need not apply).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Later examples are both humorous and instructive:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Richardson Chief Justice de Common Banc al assises de Salisbury in Summer 1631 fuit assault per prisoner la condemne pur felony, que puis son condemnation ject un brickbat a le dit justice, que narrowly mist, et pur ceo immediately fuit indictment drawn per Noy envers le prisoner et son dexter manus ampute et fix al gibbet, sur que luy mesme immediatement hange in presence de Court.  -- Sir George Treby*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*ahem*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps Law French might best be called a *deconstructed* language?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;About all that's left in modern times are a few set phrases, mostly in Parliament:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *La reyne (or le roy) remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi le veult* -- (The Queen/King thanks her/his good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *La reyne (or le roy) le veult* -- (The Queen/King wills it)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *La reyne (or le roy) s'avisera* -- (The Queen/King will advise)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Soit fait comme il est désiré* -- (Let it be done as it is desired)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even in the USA, we still hear *oyez, oyez, oyez* when court comes to order.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some interesting notes on Law French, especially pertinent to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*&quot;The effort of reporting English speech in French was not merely an expression of affection for the past, for in the long run it probably saved a lawyer more time and trouble than was taken to learn it. ...

Anglo-French was in steady decline after 1300. ... (That English lawyers could seriously complain that French, spoken in France, had deteriorated considerably as compared to its use in England) is in itself a clear demonstration that by the middle of the fifteenth century there was a marked difference between the French of English lawyers and the French of France.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*A Frenchman living in England during Elizabeth I's reign noted of Law French &quot;...now it seemeth that almost there is no language more far from the true French, then the French of our lawes: There being almost no word, which either by intermingling, or adding, or diminishing, or changing of a letter into another, they have not altered and corrupted.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*&quot;The lawyers also took what seemed to be a perverse delight in pronouncing Law French as if it were English: indeed, 'their pronunciation differeth so much from ours (French) as it is impossible for a Frenchman to understand them'.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*&quot;Few of those who used French paid the slightest attention to grammar or vocabulary.&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All taken from J.H.

I think regularity would speed up learning, as children during language learning overgeneralise (see experiments with English past tense endings). Thus instead of learning the correct exceptions at a later stage the corresponding feature would have been learned earlier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a programme for teaching [Esperanto as a first foreign language][1], as it can be used to increase second language awareness and is supposed to make learning a natural foreign language easier. You don't have to worry about exceptions, for one thing, so you can teach the concept without having to hedge your explanations by listing all the cases where it's different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My personal view on 'difficulty' of different languages is that all languages are about equally difficult. Some languages are easier/simpler regarding some features (English inflectional morphology), but make up for that in others (vast number of near-synonyms with different distributional characteristics in English). Toki Pona is a very simple language (120 words, virtually no syntactic complexity), so you can learn it almost in a day, but it is very hard to express complicated narratives, and an equivalent text in a more complex language would be far more concise. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Learning Esperanto is reasonably easy, but then you look at how people actually use it in everyday interactions, and you find that it is more difficult than you imagined: there are a lot of the smaller particles that make it tricky to understand for a beginner. But the 'early' sentences composed when the language was still fairly new are a lot simpler. However, they were not suitable for encoding all the pragmatic and other information people need for an everyday language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, there are undoubtedly features that make it easier for children to learn a language as L1, but the question is &quot;what for?&quot; It's a bit like learning Lisp programming: understanding the syntax takes literally ten minutes, but that does not mean you can write useful programs in it after that. Languages are more than the sum of syntax and vocabulary, and if there was a language that was easier to learn and use than other languages, and had equal expressive power, then we would all be speaking it already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.esperantoresearch.org.uk/site/book/files" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Languages like French are spoken both on the street and in high society, so there are multiple registers. It’s an introductory language for many people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Slang is often used to exclude; if you’re not “one of us” but you still&#xD;&#xA;Speak the language, you still are on the outside because you can’t quite follow what’s being said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A language like Quechua in South America (according to Nick) doesn’t develop slang because speaking it is already a marker for being low-status socially (vs Spanish speakers). Speaking Quechua already excludes those on the other end of the linguistic divide.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Belter is similar. Nobody but Belters speak it (maybe some inner intelligence officers do, the way UK troops would learn Irish during the troubles.

One can code shift on the fly between the two languages quite easily. If there amongst a bunch a rock hopper’s, they’ll probably all speak pure LB. When they’re on the docks, when there are more inners around, probably shift more towards English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Belters have to speak English to deal with the UN/MCRN tax&#xD;&#xA;Collectors. When they get boarded by Mickie Marines, you BETTER speak English. When they deal with the any government office, it’ll be in English. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Haiti, the majority of the population are monolingual Kreyol speakers. But the language of Education and government forms is French. That leads to some fucked-up outcomes. I imagine Belter would be treated like Creole languages usually are; something broken &amp; degenerate, not a real language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The correspondence courses Naomi took were almost certainly in English. Nobody is translating engineering textbooks into a “degenerate” language like a Creole, and nobody is teaching this classs in LB. Hinikirii Brown’s tablet on Anderson Station was in English, although he father spoke to her mostly in LB.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Miller is a perfect example of code shifting. Watch his hands throughout the seasons; for a “welwala”, he is the most hand-gesturing Belter on Ceres. When interviewing Gia (who has just had a client murdered in her room), he interviews her in LB to set her at ease. But when talking to the Governor’s agent about the water thieves, he speaks perfect English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Prax is an educated Belter. You don’t do botany classes in LB. and when he wakes up on the refugee ship, he first asks for Mei in English. When he realizes the crewman he’s speaking to is a Belter, Prax switches to LB. Prax spends so much time speaking English, shifting back into LB is something that takes a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So yeah, my feeling is the code shift mainly comes from “am I speaking to a Belter, or an Inner?” The inner/Belter dichotomy is cooked into LB down to the level of pronouns the way social hierarchy is cooked into Japanese. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;“Beltalowda” is the plural pronoun for “Belters” with the connotation of both “all Belters” as well as “us Belters” ( becaus again, almost nobody outside Belters speaks LB). “Inyalowda” is both “all inners” [No distinction between Earther or Martian], and “You inners”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This is when you make up words instead of applying a grammatical rule. For example, in German, you have to just memorize most plurals as a second word. It is easy to accidentally create lexicalizations if you mother tongue has them. For example, in some language antonyms are phrasal or morphological modifications of a base word, in English and other languages, antonyms often are a separate word.

Text="The term &quot;Standard Average European&quot; (SAE) pretty much covers it, and has been around since the 1930s. Haspelmath listed a number of typical &quot;Euroversals&quot; in [a portion of the 2001 book *Language Typology and Language Universals*][1]. These are listed in a more readable-to-laymen way in [the wikipedia article on the subject][2]. Haspelmath included as true Europeanisms (that is, features that are part of the SAE [Sprachbund][3]) only features that fit the following requirements:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Most of the &quot;core&quot; European languages possess it.&#xD;&#xA;2. Nearby languages (Celtic, Turkic, etc.) lack it.&#xD;&#xA;3. Eastern Indo-European languages (Armenian, Iranian, Indic languages, etc.) lack it -- this prevents us from merely calling it a feature of the Indo-European language family as a whole.&#xD;&#xA;4. It is not found in the majority of the world's languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Europeanisms identified by Haspelmath that fit this criteria include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Definite and indefinite articles&#xD;&#xA;- Post-nominal relative clauses with resumptive relative pronouns&#xD;&#xA;- The (transitive) perfect formed with &quot;have&quot; plus a past participle&#xD;&#xA;- [Experiencers][4] coded as nominative subjects&#xD;&#xA;- Passive formed with a participle plus &quot;to be&quot;&#xD;&#xA;- A preference for [anticausatives][5] over [causatives][6].&#xD;&#xA;- [Dative external possession][7]&#xD;&#xA;- Negation with negative pronouns and positive verb forms (e.g., &quot;Nobody comes&quot; instead of &quot;Nobody won't come.&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;- [Particle comparatives][8]&#xD;&#xA;- Relative-clause based equative constructions (e.g., &quot;*tan* Z *como* X&quot;, &quot;*so* Z *wie* X&quot;, &quot;as Z as X&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;- Subject person marking used strictly for agreement (i.e., the verb is inflected for the person/number of the subject but the subject cannot be dropped)&#xD;&#xA;- Different forms for reflexives vs. intensifiers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He also identified several other features that were common among this Sprachbund but were not as well-documented as the above, such as the verb fronting of polar interrogatives (i.e., turning &quot;I have done it&quot; into &quot;Have I done it?&quot; to make a yes/no question), an inflectional marker for the comparative, and several others -- these are also included in the linked articles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachbund&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_relation&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticausative_verb&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalienable_possession#External_possession&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://wals.info/chapter/121" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This is going to be pretty long, sorry for that. For reference, I'm using the famous [Haspelmath paper][1] as reference for which features define the SAE sprachbund, as I did in [my earlier post][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Definite and indefinite articles&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------&#xD;&#xA; Esperanto defies SAE norms out the gate here, as it **only has a definite article**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *libro* - &quot;a book&quot;   &#xD;&#xA;*la libro* - &quot;the book&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is actually quite bizarre, as those SAE languages that do not fit this criterion (such as Slavic languages, which heavily influenced Esperanto) have no articles at all. However, some neighboring non-SAE languages do have only a definite article, so this isn't too bizarre cross-linguistically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haspelmath characterizes this way of forming relative clauses, unique to SAE languages, by the following criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The relative clause is post-nominal&#xD;&#xA;- There is an inflecting relative pronoun&#xD;&#xA;- This pronoun introduces the relative clause&#xD;&#xA;- The relative pronoun functions as a resumptive, signalling the head's role in the relative clause.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto relative clauses **fit all of these criteria**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Tiu blua balono, **kion** mi estis tenanta, knalis*    &#xD;&#xA;&quot;That blue balloon, which I was holding, popped.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, the relative clause *kion mi estis tenanta* follows the nominal head *balono*. It is introduced by an inflecting relative pronoun *kion*, which is inflected for the accusative case to mark the balloon's role in the clause (that it is the object of *estas tenanta*. Pretty much prototypical SAE here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. 'Have'-perfect&#xD;&#xA;-----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many European languages used a form of &quot;to have&quot; plus a passive participle to mark what we can loosely call the perfect. The languages that possess this construction have grammaticalized it to different degrees, but according to Haspelmath, &quot;what is important here is that they all must have had basically the same meaning when they were first created.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **does not have a 'have'-perfect**. Instead, Esperanto emulates Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages in using &quot;to be&quot; + an active participle -- a form Haspelmath explicitly contrasts with the 'have'-perfect in his article.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi estas vidinta la viron.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     mi est-as vid-i-nta          la  vir-on&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     I  be-PRS see-PERF-ACT.PTCP  the man-ACC&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I have seen the man.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unsurprising given Zamenhof's language background, but not SAE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Nominative experiencers&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With &quot;verbs of sensation, emotion, cognition, and perception,&quot; there are two main strategies for expressing the experiencer -- either the experiencer is treated like an agent and marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;I like it&quot;), or it is treated like a patient or goal and the stimulus is marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;It pleases me&quot;, &quot;It is pleasing to me&quot;). English pretty much exclusively uses nominative experiencers, but this isn't strictly binary across languages -- many languages, including quite a few SAE languages, will have some verbs that do the former and some that do the latter. However, most SAE languages have a very strong tendency to prefer nominative experiencers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **primarily uses nominative experiencers**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi vidis fantomon.* - &quot;I saw a ghost.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi timas la mallumon.* - &quot;I fear the darkness.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi flaras florojn.* - &quot;I smell flowers.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto does possess at least one verb that bucks the trend, *plaĉi*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Ĉokolado plaĉas al mi*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate&quot; (lit., &quot;Chocolate is pleasing to me.&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, even this construction is gradually becoming less used over time as speakers favor the nominative experiencer verb *ŝati* instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi ŝatas ĉokoladon.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Esperanto is pretty SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Participial passive&#xD;&#xA;----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote Haspelmath: &quot;Standard Average European languages typically have a canonical passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb (&quot;be&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, or the like). In this passive the original direct object becomes the subject and the original subject may be omitted, but it may also be expressed as an adverbial agent phrase.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto passives behave pretty much exactly in this way.** Unsurprising, since none of the language families from which it draws its inspiration differ from the SAE trend here either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *La knabo estas batita (de sia fratino).*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     la  knab-o  est-as bat-i-ta           de si-a      frat-in-o&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     the boy-NOM be-PRS hit-PERF-PASS.PTCP of REFL-POSS brother-FEM-NOM&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The boy is hit (by his sister).&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Granted, these passive participle constructions in Esperanto can often be avoided using anticausitive morphology or free word order in contexts where this type of passive construction would be unavoidable in, say, English. But this construction exists and is certainly frequently used enough to be considered a nicely SAE feature of Esperanto.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Anticausative prominence&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto possesses both a causative affix *-ig* and an anticausative affix *-iĝ*, both of which are used very frequently. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     fand-i           fand-iĝ-i          brul-i             brul-ig-i&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     melt-INF         melt-ANTIC-INF     burn-INF           burn-CAUS-INF&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     &quot;to melt (tr.)&quot;  &quot;to melt (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (tr.)&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To say for certain that Esperanto has a preference for one over the other, some proper analysis of the language's vocabulary and usage would have to be done. In my limited experience, I'd say that they're about equally common in Esperanto, but it's really not possible to say without a lot more research into Esperanto verbs and their usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. Dative external possessors&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **does not have a dative case and thus cannot have dative external possessors**. Esperanto does not seem to have external possession at all in my experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is another easy one, as this SAE feature is **explicitly spelled out in the basic 16 rules of Esperanto:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 12. When another NEGATIVE word is present, the word NE [English no, not] is omitted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;           Mi ne  venis     Neniu  venis    &#xD;&#xA;&gt;           I  not come      No.one comes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. Particles in comparative constructions&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are quite a few ways of marking comparatives, but particle comparatives like the English &quot;than&quot; are pretty overwhelmingly SAE. Esperanto **uses a particle comparative**, as its *ol* is pretty much identical in function to English &quot;that&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. Relative-based equative constructions&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto's equative construction *tiel ... kiel* is actually more **transparently based on relative clauses** than the English construction, as it uses synchronic relative correlatives -- and even the English &quot;as ... as&quot; construction is considered relative-based by Haspelmath. Another transparently SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;11. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's far more common, cross-linguistically, for languages with person-marking to be pro-drop. However, several SAE languages (including French, German, and English) inflect the verb to agree with the person/number of the subject *without* allowing the subject to be dropped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While Esperanto is not pro-drop, to my knowledge, **Esperanto does not inflect verbs to agree with the person or number of the subject**, and so it avoids this SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;12. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;European languages verb frequently distinguish between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns, but using one form for both appears to be more common worldwide. English actually averts this, as it uses its reflexive in this intensifier function (e.g., &quot;He did it himself&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto's intensifier particle, *mem*, is distinct from its reflexive pronoun *si*.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li batis sin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li mem batis ĝin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit it himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, Esperanto is SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/355/what-are-the-defining-traits-of-a-euro-centric-conlang/356#356" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In order to avoid unwanted associations with works of other authors, the Elves should speak a newly invented language. What features make a conlang sound &quot;Elvish&quot; in a fantasy setting, delineating it from languages of other races (like humans, dwarves, or orcs)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My picture of Elves is heavily influenced by the works of Tolkien. The Elves are tall and strong humanoids with very long live-span living in the forests of my fantasy world. They are fond of arts and crafts and of poetry, but also engage in fights and wars when necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Elves like these are a common race in genre fiction by many authors, and they also occur in genre based games (e.g., Dungeons and Dragons). They often have typical Elvish names, and some authors also invented some bits of Elvish languages for them. So I assume there are some common features for Elvish languages. What are they?"

This is going to be pretty long, sorry for that. For reference, I'm using the famous [Haspelmath paper][1] as reference for which features define the SAE sprachbund, as I did in [my earlier post][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Definite and indefinite articles - ✗&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------&#xD;&#xA; Esperanto defies SAE norms out the gate here, as it **only has a definite article**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *libro* - &quot;a book&quot;   &#xD;&#xA;*la libro* - &quot;the book&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is actually quite bizarre, as those SAE languages that do not fit this criterion (such as Slavic languages, which heavily influenced Esperanto) have no articles at all. However, some neighboring non-SAE languages do have only a definite article, so this isn't too bizarre cross-linguistically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns - ✓&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haspelmath characterizes this way of forming relative clauses, unique to SAE languages, by the following criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The relative clause is post-nominal&#xD;&#xA;- There is an inflecting relative pronoun&#xD;&#xA;- This pronoun introduces the relative clause&#xD;&#xA;- The relative pronoun functions as a resumptive, signalling the head's role in the relative clause.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto relative clauses **fit all of these criteria**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Tiu blua balono, **kion** mi estis tenanta, knalis*    &#xD;&#xA;&quot;That blue balloon, which I was holding, popped.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, the relative clause *kion mi estis tenanta* follows the nominal head *balono*. It is introduced by an inflecting relative pronoun *kion*, which is inflected for the accusative case to mark the balloon's role in the clause (that it is the object of *estas tenanta*. Pretty much prototypical SAE here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. 'Have'-perfect - ✗&#xD;&#xA;-----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many European languages used a form of &quot;to have&quot; plus a passive participle to mark what we can loosely call the perfect. The languages that possess this construction have grammaticalized it to different degrees, but according to Haspelmath, &quot;what is important here is that they all must have had basically the same meaning when they were first created.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **does not have a 'have'-perfect**. Instead, Esperanto emulates Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages in using &quot;to be&quot; + an active participle -- a form Haspelmath explicitly contrasts with the 'have'-perfect in his article.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi estas vidinta la viron.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     mi est-as vid-i-nta          la  vir-on&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     I  be-PRS see-PERF-ACT.PTCP  the man-ACC&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I have seen the man.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unsurprising given Zamenhof's language background, but not SAE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Nominative experiencers - ✓&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With &quot;verbs of sensation, emotion, cognition, and perception,&quot; there are two main strategies for expressing the experiencer -- either the experiencer is treated like an agent and marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;I like it&quot;), or it is treated like a patient or goal and the stimulus is marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;It pleases me&quot;, &quot;It is pleasing to me&quot;). English pretty much exclusively uses nominative experiencers, but this isn't strictly binary across languages -- many languages, including quite a few SAE languages, will have some verbs that do the former and some that do the latter. However, most SAE languages have a very strong tendency to prefer nominative experiencers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **primarily uses nominative experiencers**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi vidis fantomon.* - &quot;I saw a ghost.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi timas la mallumon.* - &quot;I fear the darkness.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi flaras florojn.* - &quot;I smell flowers.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto does possess at least one verb that bucks the trend, *plaĉi*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Ĉokolado plaĉas al mi*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate&quot; (lit., &quot;Chocolate is pleasing to me.&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, even this construction is gradually becoming less used over time as speakers favor the nominative experiencer verb *ŝati* instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi ŝatas ĉokoladon.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Esperanto is pretty SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Participial passive - ✓&#xD;&#xA;----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote Haspelmath: &quot;Standard Average European languages typically have a canonical passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb (&quot;be&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, or the like). In this passive the original direct object becomes the subject and the original subject may be omitted, but it may also be expressed as an adverbial agent phrase.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto passives behave pretty much exactly in this way.** Unsurprising, since none of the language families from which it draws its inspiration differ from the SAE trend here either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *La knabo estas batita (de sia fratino).*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     la  knab-o  est-as bat-i-ta           de si-a      frat-in-o&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     the boy-NOM be-PRS hit-PERF-PASS.PTCP of REFL-POSS brother-FEM-NOM&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The boy is hit (by his sister).&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Granted, these passive participle constructions in Esperanto can often be avoided using anticausitive morphology or free word order in contexts where this type of passive construction would be unavoidable in, say, English. But this construction exists and is certainly frequently used enough to be considered a nicely SAE feature of Esperanto.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Anticausative prominence - ?&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto possesses both a causative affix *-ig* and an anticausative affix *-iĝ*, both of which are used very frequently. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     fand-i           fand-iĝ-i          brul-i             brul-ig-i&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     melt-INF         melt-ANTIC-INF     burn-INF           burn-CAUS-INF&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     &quot;to melt (tr.)&quot;  &quot;to melt (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (tr.)&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To say for certain that Esperanto has a preference for one over the other, some proper analysis of the language's vocabulary and usage would have to be done. In my limited experience, I'd say that they're about equally common in Esperanto, but it's really not possible to say without a lot more research into Esperanto verbs and their usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. Dative external possessors - ✗&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **does not have a dative case and thus cannot have dative external possessors**. Esperanto does not seem to have external possession at all in my experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation - ✓&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is another easy one, as this SAE feature is **explicitly spelled out in the basic 16 rules of Esperanto:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 12. When another NEGATIVE word is present, the word NE [English no, not] is omitted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;           Mi ne  venis     Neniu  venis    &#xD;&#xA;&gt;           I  not come      No.one comes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. Particles in comparative constructions - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are quite a few ways of marking comparatives, but particle comparatives like the English &quot;than&quot; are pretty overwhelmingly SAE. Esperanto **uses a particle comparative**, as its *ol* is pretty much identical in function to English &quot;that&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. Relative-based equative constructions - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto's equative construction *tiel ... kiel* is actually more **transparently based on relative clauses** than the English construction, as it uses synchronic relative correlatives -- and even the English &quot;as ... as&quot; construction is considered relative-based by Haspelmath. Another transparently SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;11. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers - ✗&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's far more common, cross-linguistically, for languages with person-marking to be pro-drop. However, several SAE languages (including French, German, and English) inflect the verb to agree with the person/number of the subject *without* allowing the subject to be dropped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While Esperanto is not pro-drop, to my knowledge, **Esperanto does not inflect verbs to agree with the person or number of the subject**, and so it avoids this SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;12. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;European languages verb frequently distinguish between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns, but using one form for both appears to be more common worldwide. English actually averts this, as it uses its reflexive in this intensifier function (e.g., &quot;He did it himself&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto's intensifier particle, *mem*, is distinct from its reflexive pronoun *si*.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li batis sin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li mem batis ĝin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit it himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, Esperanto is SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/355/what-are-the-defining-traits-of-a-euro-centric-conlang/356#356" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

They were used on different parts of the set, with the more logographic script occurring in a lot of the more traditional contexts and the alphabet occurring more widely throughout the set.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The Omniglot page](https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/wakandan.htm) for the script includes text written in both English and Xhosa using the script, but the Xhosa text seems transliterated from the romanized orthography for Xhosa. That said, since the author described the alphabetic script as a &quot;more evolved&quot; version of the logography, it's possible that it was deliberately designed to be similar to the Latin transliteration of Xhosa? Granted, that doesn't seem particularly in-character for the Wakanda depicted in the film, but who knows. Perhaps we'll learn more about the script in the inevitable sequel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we *can* say that the alphabetic script is not *only* used to transliterate English as it is in the title cards. Consider this image from the article, which features portions of some Wakandan signs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![image of the streets of Wakanda with several signs in Wakandan scripts][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The glyphs on the rightward sign are difficult to make out and may be part of the logographic script, but those on the leftward sign read &quot;DJO&quot; in the Wakandan script -- as neither DJO nor OJD are allowable clusters in English, it seems unlikely that this is a portion of an English word transliterated into the alphabet. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it definitely is used to transliterate English even outside of the title cards. Let's look at the text on the throne in this poster:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![image of black panther sitting on a throne decorated with Wakandan symbols][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The text on the lefthand side of his throne clearly reads &quot;WISDOM&quot; and the righthand text reads &quot;LOYALTY&quot; -- obviously an English transliteration. This is particularly egregious given that this is the king's throne, which arguably shouldn't feature the modern Wakandan script at all, much less Wakandan being used for English. However, it is admittedly a poster, so it's not really properly in the movie -- I cannot find a screenshot of the base of the throne from the actual film, so I can't say whether the text is the same there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The alphabetic script is frequently used in the set design of the lab, but the only screenshots I can find of it are either too blurry to make out or just feature simply the glyphs overlapping each other for aesthetic in a screensaver-esque fashion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZIKe.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbCtR.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This is going to be pretty long, sorry for that. For reference, I'm using the famous [Haspelmath paper][1] as reference for which features define the SAE sprachbund, as I did in [my earlier post][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Definite and indefinite articles - ✗&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------&#xD;&#xA; Esperanto defies SAE norms out the gate here, as it **only has a definite article**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *libro* - &quot;a book&quot;   &#xD;&#xA;*la libro* - &quot;the book&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is actually quite bizarre, as those SAE languages that do not fit this criterion (such as Slavic languages, which heavily influenced Esperanto) have no articles at all. However, some neighboring non-SAE languages do have only a definite article, so this isn't too bizarre cross-linguistically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns - ✓&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haspelmath characterizes this way of forming relative clauses, unique to SAE languages, by the following criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The relative clause is post-nominal&#xD;&#xA;- There is an inflecting relative pronoun&#xD;&#xA;- This pronoun introduces the relative clause&#xD;&#xA;- The relative pronoun functions as a resumptive, signalling the head's role in the relative clause.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto relative clauses **fit all of these criteria**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Tiu blua balono, **kion** mi estis tenanta, knalis*    &#xD;&#xA;&quot;That blue balloon, which I was holding, popped.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, the relative clause *kion mi estis tenanta* follows the nominal head *balono*. It is introduced by an inflecting relative pronoun *kion*, which is inflected for the accusative case to mark the balloon's role in the clause (that it is the object of *estas tenanta*. Pretty much prototypical SAE here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. 'Have'-perfect - ✗&#xD;&#xA;-----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many European languages used a form of &quot;to have&quot; plus a passive participle to mark what we can loosely call the perfect. The languages that possess this construction have grammaticalized it to different degrees, but according to Haspelmath, &quot;what is important here is that they all must have had basically the same meaning when they were first created.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **does not have a 'have'-perfect**. Instead, Esperanto emulates Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages in using &quot;to be&quot; + an active participle -- a form Haspelmath explicitly contrasts with the 'have'-perfect in his article.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi estas vidinta la viron.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     mi est-as vid-i-nta          la  vir-on&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     I  be-PRS see-PERF-ACT.PTCP  the man-ACC&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I have seen the man.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unsurprising given Zamenhof's language background, but not SAE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Nominative experiencers - ✓&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With &quot;verbs of sensation, emotion, cognition, and perception,&quot; there are two main strategies for expressing the experiencer -- either the experiencer is treated like an agent and marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;I like it&quot;), or it is treated like a patient or goal and the stimulus is marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;It pleases me&quot;, &quot;It is pleasing to me&quot;). English pretty much exclusively uses nominative experiencers, but this isn't strictly binary across languages -- many languages, including quite a few SAE languages, will have some verbs that do the former and some that do the latter. However, most SAE languages have a very strong tendency to prefer nominative experiencers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **primarily uses nominative experiencers**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi vidis fantomon.* - &quot;I saw a ghost.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi timas la mallumon.* - &quot;I fear the darkness.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi flaras florojn.* - &quot;I smell flowers.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto does possess at least one verb that bucks the trend, *plaĉi*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Ĉokolado plaĉas al mi*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate&quot; (lit., &quot;Chocolate is pleasing to me.&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, even this construction is gradually becoming less used over time as speakers favor the nominative experiencer verb *ŝati* instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi ŝatas ĉokoladon.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Esperanto is pretty SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Participial passive - ✓&#xD;&#xA;----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote Haspelmath: &quot;Standard Average European languages typically have a canonical passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb (&quot;be&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, or the like). In this passive the original direct object becomes the subject and the original subject may be omitted, but it may also be expressed as an adverbial agent phrase.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto passives behave pretty much exactly in this way.** Unsurprising, since none of the language families from which it draws its inspiration differ from the SAE trend here either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *La knabo estas batita (de sia fratino).*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     la  knab-o  est-as bat-i-ta           de si-a      frat-in-o&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     the boy-NOM be-PRS hit-PERF-PASS.PTCP of REFL-POSS brother-FEM-NOM&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The boy is hit (by his sister).&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Granted, these passive participle constructions in Esperanto can often be avoided using anticausitive morphology or free word order in contexts where this type of passive construction would be unavoidable in, say, English. But this construction exists and is certainly frequently used enough to be considered a nicely SAE feature of Esperanto.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Anticausative prominence - ?&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto possesses both a causative affix *-ig* and an anticausative affix *-iĝ*, both of which are used very frequently. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     fand-i           fand-iĝ-i          brul-i             brul-ig-i&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     melt-INF         melt-ANTIC-INF     burn-INF           burn-CAUS-INF&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     &quot;to melt (tr.)&quot;  &quot;to melt (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (tr.)&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To say for certain that Esperanto has a preference for one over the other, some proper analysis of the language's vocabulary and usage would have to be done. In my limited experience, I'd say that they're about equally common in Esperanto, but it's really not possible to say without a lot more research into Esperanto verbs and their usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. Dative external possessors - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @jknappen has pointed out, Esperanto **does allow for dative external possessors**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi lavas **al mi** la manoj.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I wash my hands.&quot; (literally, &quot;I wash to me the hands&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't personally speak for how common they are, but the only requirement for this criterion is that they exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation - ✓&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is another easy one, as this SAE feature is **explicitly spelled out in the basic 16 rules of Esperanto:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 12. When another NEGATIVE word is present, the word NE [English no, not] is omitted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;           Mi ne  venis     Neniu  venis    &#xD;&#xA;&gt;           I  not come      No.one comes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. Particles in comparative constructions - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are quite a few ways of marking comparatives, but particle comparatives like the English &quot;than&quot; are pretty overwhelmingly SAE. Esperanto **uses a particle comparative**, as its *ol* is pretty much identical in function to English &quot;that&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. Relative-based equative constructions - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto's equative construction *tiel ... kiel* is actually more **transparently based on relative clauses** than the English construction, as it uses synchronic relative correlatives -- and even the English &quot;as ... as&quot; construction is considered relative-based by Haspelmath. Another transparently SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;11. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers - ✗&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's far more common, cross-linguistically, for languages with person-marking to be pro-drop. However, several SAE languages (including French, German, and English) inflect the verb to agree with the person/number of the subject *without* allowing the subject to be dropped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While Esperanto is not pro-drop, to my knowledge, **Esperanto does not inflect verbs to agree with the person or number of the subject**, and so it avoids this SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;12. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;European languages verb frequently distinguish between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns, but using one form for both appears to be more common worldwide. English actually averts this, as it uses its reflexive in this intensifier function (e.g., &quot;He did it himself&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto's intensifier particle, *mem*, is distinct from its reflexive pronoun *si*.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li batis sin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li mem batis ĝin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit it himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, Esperanto is SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/355/what-are-the-defining-traits-of-a-euro-centric-conlang/356#356" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Text="Tl;dr: Esperanto possesses about 8/12 SAE features&#xD;&#xA;====================================================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's go through these features one by one. This is going to be pretty long, sorry for that. For reference, I'm using the famous [Haspelmath paper][1] as reference for which features define the SAE sprachbund, as I did in [my earlier post][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Definite and indefinite articles - ✗&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------&#xD;&#xA; Esperanto defies SAE norms out the gate here, as it **only has a definite article**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *libro* - &quot;a book&quot;   &#xD;&#xA;*la libro* - &quot;the book&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is actually quite bizarre, as those SAE languages that do not fit this criterion (such as Slavic languages, which heavily influenced Esperanto) have no articles at all. However, some neighboring non-SAE languages do have only a definite article, so this isn't too bizarre cross-linguistically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns - ✓&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haspelmath characterizes this way of forming relative clauses, unique to SAE languages, by the following criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The relative clause is post-nominal&#xD;&#xA;- There is an inflecting relative pronoun&#xD;&#xA;- This pronoun introduces the relative clause&#xD;&#xA;- The relative pronoun functions as a resumptive, signalling the head's role in the relative clause.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto relative clauses **fit all of these criteria**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Tiu blua balono, **kion** mi estis tenanta, knalis*    &#xD;&#xA;&quot;That blue balloon, which I was holding, popped.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, the relative clause *kion mi estis tenanta* follows the nominal head *balono*. It is introduced by an inflecting relative pronoun *kion*, which is inflected for the accusative case to mark the balloon's role in the clause (that it is the object of *estas tenanta*. Pretty much prototypical SAE here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. 'Have'-perfect - ✗&#xD;&#xA;-----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many European languages used a form of &quot;to have&quot; plus a passive participle to mark what we can loosely call the perfect. The languages that possess this construction have grammaticalized it to different degrees, but according to Haspelmath, &quot;what is important here is that they all must have had basically the same meaning when they were first created.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **does not have a 'have'-perfect**. Instead, Esperanto emulates Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages in using &quot;to be&quot; + an active participle -- a form Haspelmath explicitly contrasts with the 'have'-perfect in his article.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi estas vidinta la viron.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     mi est-as vid-i-nta          la  vir-on&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     I  be-PRS see-PERF-ACT.PTCP  the man-ACC&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I have seen the man.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unsurprising given Zamenhof's language background, but not SAE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Nominative experiencers - ✓&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With &quot;verbs of sensation, emotion, cognition, and perception,&quot; there are two main strategies for expressing the experiencer -- either the experiencer is treated like an agent and marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;I like it&quot;), or it is treated like a patient or goal and the stimulus is marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;It pleases me&quot;, &quot;It is pleasing to me&quot;). English pretty much exclusively uses nominative experiencers, but this isn't strictly binary across languages -- many languages, including quite a few SAE languages, will have some verbs that do the former and some that do the latter. However, most SAE languages have a very strong tendency to prefer nominative experiencers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto **primarily uses nominative experiencers**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi vidis fantomon.* - &quot;I saw a ghost.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi timas la mallumon.* - &quot;I fear the darkness.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - *Mi flaras florojn.* - &quot;I smell flowers.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto does possess at least one verb that bucks the trend, *plaĉi*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Ĉokolado plaĉas al mi*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate&quot; (lit., &quot;Chocolate is pleasing to me.&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, even this construction is gradually becoming less used over time as speakers favor the nominative experiencer verb *ŝati* instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi ŝatas ĉokoladon.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I like chocolate.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Esperanto is pretty SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Participial passive - ✓&#xD;&#xA;----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote Haspelmath: &quot;Standard Average European languages typically have a canonical passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb (&quot;be&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, or the like). In this passive the original direct object becomes the subject and the original subject may be omitted, but it may also be expressed as an adverbial agent phrase.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto passives behave pretty much exactly in this way.** Unsurprising, since none of the language families from which it draws its inspiration differ from the SAE trend here either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *La knabo estas batita (de sia fratino).*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     la  knab-o  est-as bat-i-ta           de si-a      frat-in-o&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     the boy-NOM be-PRS hit-PERF-PASS.PTCP of REFL-POSS brother-FEM-NOM&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The boy is hit (by his sister).&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Granted, these passive participle constructions in Esperanto can often be avoided using anticausitive morphology or free word order in contexts where this type of passive construction would be unavoidable in, say, English. But this construction exists and is certainly frequently used enough to be considered a nicely SAE feature of Esperanto.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Anticausative prominence - ?&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto possesses both a causative affix *-ig* and an anticausative affix *-iĝ*, both of which are used very frequently. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     fand-i           fand-iĝ-i          brul-i             brul-ig-i&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     melt-INF         melt-ANTIC-INF     burn-INF           burn-CAUS-INF&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     &quot;to melt (tr.)&quot;  &quot;to melt (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (tr.)&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To say for certain that Esperanto has a preference for one over the other, some proper analysis of the language's vocabulary and usage would have to be done. In my limited experience, I'd say that they're about equally common in Esperanto, but it's really not possible to say without a lot more research into Esperanto verbs and their usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. Dative external possessors - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @jknappen has pointed out, Esperanto **does allow for dative external possessors**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Mi lavas **al mi** la manoj.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I wash my hands.&quot; (literally, &quot;I wash to me the hands&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't personally speak for how common they are, but the only requirement for this criterion is that they exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation - ✓&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is another easy one, as this SAE feature is **explicitly spelled out in the basic 16 rules of Esperanto:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 12. When another NEGATIVE word is present, the word NE [English no, not] is omitted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;           Mi ne  venis     Neniu  venis    &#xD;&#xA;&gt;           I  not come      No.one comes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. Particles in comparative constructions - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are quite a few ways of marking comparatives, but particle comparatives like the English &quot;than&quot; are pretty overwhelmingly SAE. Esperanto **uses a particle comparative**, as its *ol* is pretty much identical in function to English &quot;that&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. Relative-based equative constructions - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto's equative construction *tiel ... kiel* is actually more **transparently based on relative clauses** than the English construction, as it uses synchronic relative correlatives -- and even the English &quot;as ... as&quot; construction is considered relative-based by Haspelmath. Another transparently SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;11. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers - ✗&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's far more common, cross-linguistically, for languages with person-marking to be pro-drop. However, several SAE languages (including French, German, and English) inflect the verb to agree with the person/number of the subject *without* allowing the subject to be dropped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While Esperanto is not pro-drop, to my knowledge, **Esperanto does not inflect verbs to agree with the person or number of the subject**, and so it avoids this SAE feature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;12. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation - ✓&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;European languages verb frequently distinguish between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns, but using one form for both appears to be more common worldwide. English actually averts this, as it uses its reflexive in this intensifier function (e.g., &quot;He did it himself&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Esperanto's intensifier particle, *mem*, is distinct from its reflexive pronoun *si*.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li batis sin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Li mem batis ĝin.*    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He hit it himself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, Esperanto is SAE in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/355/what-are-the-defining-traits-of-a-euro-centric-conlang/356#356" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

An example from the Australian language Walmajarri is *ma-rna-n-ta-lu*, where *ma* is the auxiliary to which the suffixes are attached. However as your word is used for carrying the TAM (Tense/Aspect/Mood) suffixes another term is **copula**. Copulas are often verbs (such as the English *be*) but not in all languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a natlang I would strongly warn you that just because you haven't yet identified a meaning for the auxiliary, you shouldn't assume that it does not has one. As you're making a conlang you can declare that it truly has no meaning whatsoever, but do realise that makes it rather unnatural. In natlangs it's extremely uncommon to say something without it meaning something. For example, in Walmajarri the *ma* auxiliary is one of two auxiliaries, which communicate different modality or information structure meanings. Unless the auxiliary is very short (in which case it could be analysed as [epenthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis) or just an allomorph of the tense morpheme) then if naturalism is at all a design goal it should carry some semantic or pragmatic meaning.

Even within the same language, often some borrowed words will be more integrated into the language than others. The more recently a word was borrowed, the more speakers of the language will treat it as a &quot;foreign&quot; word and be willing to make exceptions for it, but as its use becomes more and more common, speakers will inevitably begin to treat it as a native word if it doesn't fall out of use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does the borrowed word take on the conjugation/declension pattern of destlang?&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes, sometimes not. There are examples of both in natlangs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The English verb &quot;to google&quot; has been borrowed into many languages, and it seems to typically conform to the conjugation patterns of those languages. Even in Japanese, a language with a famously closed class of verbs, borrowed &quot;to google&quot; as a verb ググる(it may have become a verb after being borrowed as a noun, but either way, it's quite remarkable).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet it's also possible for exceptions to be made. This happens with some English noun borrowings (most English speakers won't try to pluralize *edamame* or *Pokémon* with English plural morphology), but not with others (many English speakers will pluralize *zucchini* as *zucchinis*, and you'll pretty much never heard *zucchino*).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience, verbs are more likely to take on the native conjugation patterns than nouns are native declension patterns, but I don't have any data to back that up cross-linguistically. A borrowed word *is* definitely more likely to be conjugated or declined like a native one the longer it has been in the language (the pedantry about pluralizing Latin borrowings in English is an exception to this, but that's more because of the social prestige associated with having studied Latin).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does the borrowed word get re-spelled to conform to destlang’s orthographical conventions?&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This really is a case-by-case thing. If the language uses a completely different writing system, almost definitely, but sometimes the orthographical conventions won't be the same as native words. Japanese uses katakana for borrowings, for instance, and English borrowings from Japanese and Chinese tend to follow whatever romanization scheme was most popular when they were borrowed, even if the pronunciation is pretty opaque. For instance, the Chinese word 道 was borrowed as &quot;Tao&quot; in English based on older Chinese romanizations, even though the Chinese word now romanized as *dào* and the English derived word &quot;Taoism&quot; is more often pronounced /ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/ in English (though a spelling pronunciation /ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/ has arisen due to this).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does the borrowed word’s pronunciation get changed to conform to destlang’s phonemic conventions (e.g., elimination of consonant blends, all syllables must end in a vowel, etc.)?&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***Almost always yes.*** While sometimes educated speakers or upper-class speakers will try to pronounce a borrowed word with its &quot;original pronunciation&quot; rather than its borrowed one (&quot;gyro&quot; is a good example of this), even those pronunciations are almost always somewhat changed to fit the destlang's phonology better, and often they aren't even closer to the pronunciation in the sourcelang. How exactly the word is altered to fit the destlang's phonology depends on the particulars of the borrowing situation, however.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What sort of methods exist for choosing which words to borrow? What causes a “native” word to fall out of use in favor of a borrowing, or, contrariwise, why would both the “native” word and the borrowed word stay in use?&#xD;&#xA;========================================================================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've combined these questions because I feel there's a lot of overlap in the answers. Often, words are borrowed to fill a semantic gap in the destlang, which is why words for new technologies are so often borrowed (think of how many languages borrowed the word &quot;television&quot;!) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Borrowings are also often used to refer to the &quot;versions&quot; of certain things from the part of the world that speaks that language -- consider how *anime*, a generic word for all animation in Japanese, was borrowed into English as a word for a style of Japanese animation, or how English borrowed &quot;chai&quot; from the Hindi/Urdu word for tea, चाय (cāy) / چای‎ (ćāy) to refer to tea with certain spices based on Indian recipes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, sometimes words are borrowed because they carry some social value seen attractive by the speakers of destlang. Maybe destlang speakers think sourcelang sounds refined and sophisticated, and so upper-class destlang speakers borrow words from sourcelang to sound fancy. Of course, this sort of situation depends on a lot of social and sociopolitical factors wherever the languages are spoken." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

These are called 'Wanderwoerter', or 'wandering words' in German. All the words for 'tea' in our world, for instance, can be traced back to just two distinct roots. One gave rise to the word for tea in China and Mongolia, the other is the common ancestor for the words for 'tea' everywhere else. Words for region-specific materials also tend to get borrowed. Though they can also just be named after foreign locations that the people who speak the destlang got the material from (we have quite a number of these in English).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Words for technologies also tend to migrate. Hungarian has multiple words related to horse riding that originated in Turkish. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note how English likes to borrow foreign words for foreign objects. We have words like sombrero from Spanish and kimono from Japanese. Note however that borrowed words may not hold the same meaning as they do in their parent languages. In Spanish the word 'sombrero' is the word for any hat with a brim. And kimono is the name for a specific garment, but in English we normally use it to refer to any kind of traditional Japanese dress. This is pretty common cross-linguistically. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note that some languages borrow foreign words more than others. Some prefer to just derive new words from native words. Finnish used to be like this. German still is to a large extent (though that doesn't mean loan words don't exist in German, there are a few from French and English, such as bon-bon, pommes frites, and jeans)."

Esperanto is a very regular language, and that makes it easy to learn. Other languages, such as Interlingua, are not as easy to learn, but are meant to be more recognizable to someone already familiar with the vocabulary of Romance languages. It is still more regular than the natural languages it's based on, so it likely is easier to learn, but it sacrifices some regularity in order to have a more familiar vocabulary."

When you want to name fictional people, create a system of given names. When you want to have some dialogues, mottoes, or set phrases: Create just them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are aiming at an international auxilliary language, create a system of derivational morphology first, then fill in stems and roots and function words. At some time, you will go through some dictionary and think of a word or expression for every dictionary entry. The risk of doing it too early is ending with a relex of the starting language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;BTW, the comment by @The Mattbat999 also has good advice: before creating words, think of the sounds of your language (phonology) and of allowed combinations of the sounds (phonotactics)."

Despite the diversity in our world, I've found it surprisingly hard to find a multitude of systems to draw from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem is: writing systems have different factors that can influence their design. Syllabraries tend to have more complex characters than alphabets, because they don't have to write as many of them to spell out a word. And besides, they need a wider diversity of symbols anyway. Logographic systems are no different. Also the medium makes a huge difference. The aesthetic of one script may not be too practical to replicate using a medium it wasn't intended for. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've found this all divides up writing systems into multiple different categories based on design. This means that if you stick with a certain medium and type of writing system, you won't have much to go off of. Like, if you look at alphabets, all that really seems to be out there is Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Korean. And if you look at cursive scripts, you only really have two options: English cursive, and Arabic, which is technically an abjad. And of course if you want a logographic system, the only living logographic system (aka, the only one to see use in a world where literacy was normal writing was part of every day life) is Chinese. Beyond that, all you have to look at are long extinct logographic systems that were all made to be carved into stone. Or cuneiform, which used some rather odd tools and medium to write. How many systems do you know of that were written in clay, and were always stamped rather than drawn?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't come up with forms that really look overly different from the few alphabets currently in use. Worse yet, most of them are closely related to each other! It seems like every symbol possible has already been used in a writing system somewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only thing that has really helped me is I've noticed that most lower-case Latin letters are built from a limited number of shapes: a circle, loop, short line, long line, long line with a loop, and a dot. Sadly, I can't really come up with any practical letter forms that don't use these shapes. They're pretty simple and basic." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In English it is a structurally different way of forming a sentence, but in other languages it may have a more regular structure with a particular verb form that fits into a wider affix paradigm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *Should* is usually weaker than the imperative, giving a recommendation. Possible labels include [**hortative**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortative) and [**propositive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositive_mood).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *Have to*, *need to* and *must* can all be stronger than the imperative, but they also often imply that the person giving the instruction needs to plead to some extent with those they are instructing; an autocratic dictator would never tell their servants that they need to do something, they would simply tell them to do it (with an imperative sentence.) Labels include [**precative**](https://glossary.sil.org/term/precative-mood) for requests, and [**directive**](https://glossary.sil.org/term/directive-modality) and [**obligative**](https://glossary.sil.org/term/obligative-mood) for commands that emphasise obligation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - When *will* or *shall* is emphasised and stressed in English they are used for very serious sentences, which sometimes sound almost sinister with an implied threat for those who disregard them. The label [**commissive**](https://glossary.sil.org/term/commissive-modality) is used for threats, but not exclusively, as it's also used for promises." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Some beacon mountains have names of their own without an element meaning &quot;mountain&quot; (e.g., *Brocken*, *Großer Belchen*, *Kahler Asten*, or *Eiger*).

Yes, aspect isn't mentioned in the 16 Rules. However, this clearly doesn't mean Esperanto completely lacks aspect -- the 16 Rules are not intended to be a linguistically rigorous analysis of Esperanto, but merely a set of easy rules to teach laymen. Zamenhof definitely designed Esperanto containing some aspectual markers, especially given the amount of influence he took from Slavic languages; what is unclear is exactly *how much* aspectual information he intended to be encoded in certain markers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on your description of Esperanto's complex tenses and your claim that &quot;these aspects do not even occur in a pure form in English&quot;, you seem to be under the impression that to truly be present in a language, an aspect must be marked by a single morpheme rather than through syntactic constructions like the verb + participle constructions in English and Esperanto &quot;complex tenses.&quot; However, that isn't how that works. The English present/past continuous constructions do mark progressive/continuous aspect. The English present/past perfect constructions do mark the perfect, though &quot;perfect&quot; is a bit more of a complex mix of tense and aspect than it is pure aspect. The fact that certain syntactic constructions are used here rather than a single affix does not make the aspectual marking here any less &quot;pure&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There actually has historically been some debate over how Esperanto participles mark aspect when used in complex tenses. Zamenhof himself saw Esperanto participles as marking a mixture of tense and aspect, and this resulted in a divide among Esperantists regarding whether to translate, say &quot;The house was built long ago&quot; with *estis konstruata* (because the participle happens at the same time as the main verb) or with *estis konstruita* (as the building is accomplished and focused on describing its result). The latter group largely won out with an un-official notice from the Academy in 1965, which gave the following positions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. The Esperanto tense system consists of but three tenses: the present, the past, and the future.    &#xD;&#xA;2. All other time relationships (such as the pluperfect, future perfect, etc. of many other languages) are expressed by adverbs, conjunctions, or simply by context.    &#xD;&#xA;3. The six participles, used either with nouns or with the verb esti, show aspect, not tense. They show, in other words, in what phase of the action the subject finds himself with respect to the object: whether beginning and unfinished (-ant, -at), finished and fulfilled (-int, -it), or not yet begun but intended or awaited (-ont, -ot).   &#xD;&#xA;4. Accordingly the forms with -ata focus upon the duration or repetition of the act, and the forms with -ita focus upon the result of the act. The forms with -ita can also show priority in time in the event that there is separate evidence of that in the sentence, such as a word like jam = “already.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Quoted from [Being Colloquial in Esperanto's Appendix on Participles](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/eo/colloq/colloq200.html#sec20-2), which goes into more detail about the conflict here.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While this treatment of Esperanto participles are markers exclusively of aspect is technically not an official order from the Academy, it has generally been treated as such my most Esperantists, and this is largely how Esperantists use participles -- the *-anta/-ata* participles marking the continuous/progressive, the *-inta/-ita* participles marking the resultative, and the *-onta/-ota* participles marking the prospective. This is consistent with how they're used outside of the complex tenses as well. Based on this, one would have to willfully ignore a lot of Esperanto usage and convention to claim its participles *don't* mark aspect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the obvious aspect marking on the participles, it should also be noted a few other affixes mark what could be considered aspect. You've mentioned *ek-* as a marker of inchoative aspect yourself (it could also be said to mark the momentane). *-iĝ-* could also be said to have some inchoative flavor to it (though it's a bit more obscured among its other functions, consider that *eksidi* and *sidiĝi* are near-synonymous), and *-ad-* similarly can mark something like continuative or iterative aspect.

For example, if a language has a plosive, then it'll probably have several. Likewise, if it has a voiced plosive, it'll probably have other voiced consonants, possibly of other points of articulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, this just the majority of the time. English, for instance has only one palatal consonant (the 'y' sound) and only one lateral (our 'l'). Though few languages have more than one lateral consonant (assuming they have any at all), and 'y' is the only common palatal consonant. All the others are rare.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There, however, a few universals. All languages have voiceless stops. They may only have one (and there are that do), but they will always have one. Also, all languages have monophthongs. So that means that there aren't any natural language out there that only have diphthongs for vowels. Note however, that diphthongs in a language can be made up of monophthongs that don't exist in the language. Take note that the English 'o' sound is actually a diphthong. English doesn't have the monophthong 'o' for some reason. This is why books that teach you foreign languages often tell you cut off the last part of the 'o' sound. What they're actually trying to get you to do is not do the off-glide that our 'o' normally has.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that though, there are no universals. No one phone is found in all languages. And exactly how many phonemes a language has varies widely. The most common is 5 vowels (the standard 5-vowel array you see everywhere) and 20 to 25 consonants. But there's languages with only half a dozen consonants, and others that have dozens. Then there's the case of Ubykh, which not only has dozens of consonants but only contains 2 vowels, which are of course prone to considerable allophony. In general, its hard to find languages that have fewer than 5 vowels, but they do exist. Several native languages up in Canada only have 4 vowels. The Semitic languages only have 3 vowels (well, modern Arabic also has 2 diphtongs, and its three monophthongs distinguish length, though classical Arabic only had 3 monophthongs, I don't know about Hebrew)."

Its common for languages to have the rhyme of a word mean something, but I've never heard of the onset of the word meaning anything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And yes, I'm aware of the 'consonant mutations' of the Celtic languages, but those are triggered by agreement. They can't indicate anything on their own, as far as I know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying that all conlangs have to be like natlangs, but in my experience, there's some things that languages do where there's a very good practical reason why they do them. If you come up with something that no natlang does, there may be a good reason for that. Humans for example seem to favor placing the subject of the sentence at the beginning. If you say try to place the verb first, you end up with a lot of weird problems. Of course, there are verb-initial languages, but they're rare and tend to feature very exotic grammars (Tagalog comes to mind)." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Also be sure to keep in mind that different scripts are better for different writing materials -- will the Chinese be able to continue to produce the kinds of paper, ink, and brushes they're used to in the Americas?

Same goes for bilabial trill.  &#xD;&#xA; - Prenasalization, unclosed plosives and similar modifications are non-European (I don't know much about their ease of pronunciation).  &#xD;&#xA; - You could go with something like Kaybop and have manual percussives (Kaybop has clap [bimanual percussive] and facepalm [faciomanual percussive]), which is very unnatural (maybe a bidigital percussive?).

That means, with fewer sounds you need to make the words a lot longer if you want to have a decent-sized vocabulary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, vowel pronunciation is more varied. There aren't many different ways to pronounce /t/ or /k/, but any regional dialect will change vowels. Partly because there are no fixed places of articulation: vowels are distinguished by the opening of the jaw and the position of the tongue. Both of these are almost infinitely variable compared to closing your lips and releasing them (as you'd do for a /p/ or a /b/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally, why would you disregard most potential sounds that the human vocal apparatus can produce? It's just not an efficient use of your anatomy.

To indicate other tenses (preterite/past imperfect/subjunctive/future/etc) I use the combined phrase &quot;sona,&quot; meaning &quot;in (the) time (of)&quot; and then adding a various suffix to indicate the specific tense(&quot;sonasato&quot;=&quot;in time past&quot;). This means I only have the present tense of conjugations per verb, not changing the actions of the subject per tense. (In English, you have &quot;I eat&quot; (present) and &quot;I ate&quot; (past), as one example. In my conlang, you use &quot;In the time of past, I eat.&quot; (Past, but using a present conjugation.) What I'm wondering about are the places where I should put this simple tense indicator in a sentence. The conlang's sentence structure is like this (using an example from English as translation):&#xD;&#xA;English:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;The dog drank from a bowl of water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The dog(determiner+noun)-&gt; drinks (conjugated verb, &quot;it drinks&quot;) from (preposition) a bowl (determiner+noun) of (preposition) water (noun). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my conlang, you would say&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sepyew (&quot;(it) drinks&quot;, conjugated form of &quot;to drink&quot; in present tense) eu bítõe (the dog) de è roum (from a bowl, this would be contracted into &quot;dè roum&quot; or &quot;dèroum.&quot;) de aqua (of water.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This, however, was the present tense. The past tense (The dog _drank_ from a bowl of water) involves the &quot;sonasato&quot;(in the past tense)  in some form, but I don't know where the most logical place to place it would be. Ordinarily, that wouldn't present a problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, my conlang has no punctuation, that is to say, sentences are one long string of words. I've not considered how to handle this with dialogue, but otherwise it hasn't presented a problem until now.  Pauses for breath within conversation are natural, but I'm **addressing this question from the written aspect of language**. Because the sentences are fluid, I don't know how to handle the abrupt changes between tenses other than using the &quot;sona&quot; variants excessively. And the rules of the language mean that the tense is always expressed, per statement (not sentence, because of the punctuation) by either ignoring the sona rule (indicating the present tense) or by using it (to indicate some other tense.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Question&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keeping that in mind, what would be the most logical place to place the tense indicator so that I can change it relatively easily between tenses in a language with no periods or commas (pauses), and where?&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

However, I still believe that we can come up with language features that make a language easy to learn in general. To measure this, you would want to take the number of hours it takes to achieve a certain level of proficiency in a target language from 50 source languages (the languages with the most speakers). After this come up with an average by weighting the numbers based on number of speakers. A language with an average of 456 hours would be easier to learn for the average person than a language with an average of 678 hours. This is of course not a method of deriving 'absolute' difficulty but it's good enough for what I want. Now, actually running this experiment would take a lot of time but for now it's good as a thought experiment to figure out what the goal is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Phonology**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trying to get the sounds right in a new language can be very time consuming. To counteract this an easy language should use phonemes that are common amongst the world's most spoken languages. As Richard noted in the comments the language Toki Pona has a very simple phonology that would be perfect for this. Toki Pona has nine consonants p, t, k, s, m, n, l, j, w and five vowels a, e, i, o, u. Not only are these very common phonemes but there is also the added benefit that there are no voiced/voiceless pairs. The reason this is useful is because it helps people whose language contains only one of the voiced or voiceless forms of a consonant. As an example, Arabic has no 'p' sound and therefore when they see the world 'pala' in a theoretical easy language they might pronounce it as 'bala'. Since there is no 'b' sound people will recognize that they are saying 'pala'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Vocabulary**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having a vocabulary that everyone would recognize would be useful but it's unfortunately not possible. The best attempts at creating such a vocabulary would only be useful for around 15 percent of the world's population. Add to this the fact that phonology is more important, and using the simplified phonology, you would not even be able to mimic a lot of the vocabulary from a natural language. However, there are still some things that would help make a language's vocabulary easier to learn: avoiding homonyms, making common words short, constructing words to be easy to pronounce (ex. avoiding complex consonant clusters).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Writing System**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It has been proven that phonetic writing systems are easier to learn than logographic systems. Between phonetic writing systems (alphabet, abugida, abjad) it's less clear what the easier to learn system is. However, it doesn't really matter due to the overwhelming adoption of the Latin script world wide (70% of the world's population use it). Even in places where the native language does not use the Latin script people will still have significant exposure to it. Because of this an easy to learn language should use the Latin script. The words should also be completely phonetic in their spelling. This allows learners to read, pronounce, and spell any word without having to memorize a bunch of spelling rules and exceptions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Regularity**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This one is self explanatory. A language that has regular grammar and no exceptions to its grammar rules is easier to learn. This should apply to all forms of grammar (inflections, word order, usages). As an example, if English were to always use -ed to make verbs past tense it would be easier to learn (swimmed, eated, falled).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Lack of Unnecessary Features**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just as biological evolution has left human bodies with a large amount of inefficiencies, language evolution has left natural languages with a large amount of inefficiencies. It would take a long time to go through these as there are many, so I'll just use the gender example from the question. As jknappen said in the comments grammatical genders do have a small amount of communicative power in that they can, on occasion, avoid ambiguity of two things. However, this only happens when there are two things potentially being referred to, when it's not clear based on context which thing is being referred to, and when the two things are different genders. Example from Wikipedia: &quot;a flowerbed in the garden which I maintain&quot; vs &quot;ein Blumenbeet im Garten, das ich pflege&quot;. This is very rare and not useful enough to merit spending a significant amount of time learning genders." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Though this is more useful in systems where everything has gender. In English for example, this is only useful in about 20% of cases, because only people can be referred to as he and she (everything else just gets 'it', except for maybe pets). In French however, where every noun is referred to as either he or she, this helps out about 80% of the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And as people have mentioned, gender agreement can help tie nouns and adjectives together, allowing you to put them in any order.

Unless you know about rugby, you are likely to not have a clue what the speaker is on about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you cannot really regulate the content of your language, but only vocabulary and syntax, you cannot stop speakers from using metaphors. It is the responsibility of the speaker to make sure they are understood by their target audience, so avoiding metaphors or culture-specific expressions/assumptions is generally a good idea, but it has to come from the speaker, not the designer.

Depending on whether the glottis is active, these sounds can be classified as voiced or unvoiced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The former are called vowels: they are always voiced, and are defined through the positions of jaw and tongue.

This is when you make up words instead of applying a grammatical rule. For example, in German, you have to just memorize most plurals as a second word. It is easy to accidentally create lexicalizations if you mother tongue has them. For example, in some language antonyms are phrasal or morphological modifications of a base word, in English and other languages, antonyms often are a separate word.

There are dual-only nouns for things that *only* occur in the described pairs (such as a romantic couple) and dual forms of ordinary nouns in “natural” couple forms (a pair of shoes, the poles of a magnet, my eyes - not two houses or a couple of road signs).

We usually learn the two together, and thus learn the mapping between them. These can vary in how obvious they are. At one extreme are languages that use a very standard mapping. It is virtually impossible to be able to read the Roman alphabet - in English or French, say, and to be able to speak Portuguese, but not to be able to read Portuguese, as a friend of mine found out. She had these skills but had never learnt to read Portuguese. Her mum was shocked to find her reading a book in Portuguese and asked where she learnt to do that. She had not learnt - she could just do it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next step is English or Gaelic (and not many other languages) where the mapping is so poor that it is possible to be fluent in the spoken language, and not to be able to read the language, even though you can read another language in the same alphabet. 100 years ago there was a famous disaster involving a ship called the [Iolaire][1]. Virtually everyone on board, and the bereaved relatives, had Gaelic as a first language, but they could not read Gaelic and so had no idea the ship's name was Gaelic - they pronounced it as an English person would and had no idea what the name meant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next come languages like Chinese, which is in fact several spoken languages, with one written language. The symbol 米 means rice. How you pronounce it varies according to whether you speak Mandarin or Cantonese, or even Japanese which sometimes uses Chinese symbols ([Kanji][2]). Thus you can learn written Mandarin (you now know one word) with no clue as to how to pronounce it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We use some logograms in English. Some, such as ☏, are pictographic in origin, and so have no inherent pronunciation - we just translate them to English as we read them. Others, such as &amp;, are alphabetic in origin. This one is a fancy way to write *et*, which is Latin or French for &quot;and&quot;. We ignore this and just pronounce it &quot;and&quot;. Of course other people, such as the Germans, will pronounce these symbols differently.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could always learn a natural or constructed language from a book that had no pronunciation guide, if it was written in Cyrillic, using Chinese characters, or using its own made-up logograms. But of course, you could find out how to pronounce it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next, a language could be constructed without a vocal form. I am not aware that this has occurred. The problem here is that there is no way stop someone inventing a vocal form for each symbol. This is a bit like learning Old English or Ancient Greek. We do not know exactly how they were pronounced, and so we use what is basically a modern guess.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only examples I can think of where there is no vocal form is the sign languages used by deaf communities. They are genuine languages, unlike signed English, and usually have no accepted spoken or written form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMY_Iolaire&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This occurs when a string that is an affix also occurs within a root word. For example, the suffix *-em* means &quot;a tendency/propensity for...&quot;, deriving words like *kompatema* &quot;charitable&quot; and *kompatemo* &quot;charity/mercifulness&quot; from *kompato* &quot;compasson, pity&quot;. However, what of a word like *modemo*? The root *mod-* means &quot;fashion&quot;, so upon encountering this word you might assume it means &quot;tendency to be fashionable&quot; or something like that, but it's also a root of its own meaning &quot;modem&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, realistically, this would be distinguishable from context, but then again that's the case for &quot;watt&quot; vs. &quot;cotton wool&quot; too. These sorts of weird ambiguities based on affixes are pretty rare anyway, and I don't think there's anything wrong with Esperanto having a few, but they aren't nonexistent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, it's worth noting that when it came to &quot;logical, regular design&quot;, Zamenhof was mostly concerned with avoiding irregularities in inflection and derivation.

The [Lord of the Rings Wikia](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Khuzdul) states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It appears to be structured, like real-world Semitic languages, around the triconsonantal roots: kh-z-d, b-n-d, z-g-l.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, from [folk.uib.no](https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The basic structure of Khuzdul resembles that of Semitic languages, like Arabic and Hebrew. The stems from which words are derived are not by themselves pronounceable words, but consist of consonants only. Nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. are derived not only by prefixes and suffixes (if such devices are used at all), but also by inserting certain vowels between these consonants, sometimes also by doubling one of the consonants. Often the words are actually inflected by internal vowel-changes instead of adding affixes: Rukhs means &quot;Orc&quot;, but plural &quot;Orcs&quot; is Rakhâs. The root consonants - the so-called radicals - remain the same, like *R-Kh-S in this case. In Khuzdul as well as in Semitic languages, there are usually three radicals in the root; several such roots are mentioned in TI:174 and RS:466: B-R-Z &quot;red&quot;, B-N-D &quot;head&quot;, K-B-L &quot;silver&quot;, N-R-G &quot;black&quot;. An example of a biconsonantal root is Z-N &quot;dark, dim&quot; (RS:466).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Baruk Khazâd!** is said to mean &quot;Axes of the Dwarves!&quot; Baruk is usually taken to be an example of something similar to the Hebrew &quot;construct state&quot;: the state a word is said to be in when it is placed in front of a noun to express a genitival relationship: X Y meaning &quot;X of Y&quot; or &quot;Y's X&quot;. (Compare Hebrew סוס (sûs) &quot;horse&quot;, המלך (hammelekh) &quot;the king&quot;, סוס המלך (sûs hammelekh) &quot;the king's horse, the horse of the king&quot;.) Of course, we cannot be certain that baruk is the normal plural &quot;axes&quot; and not a specialized form meaning &quot;axes of&quot;. It may be significant that all the other attested plurals contain a long vowel: Khazâd &quot;Dwarves&quot;, Rakhâs &quot;Orcs&quot;, tarâg &quot;beards&quot;, shathûr &quot;clouds&quot;, ûl &quot;streams&quot;, dûm &quot;excavations, halls&quot;, bizâr &quot;valleys&quot;. Could the normal plural &quot;axes&quot; be *barûk? Shathûr &quot;clouds&quot; may represent a plural pattern in -a-û-. In Hebrew, the vowels of words in the construct state are often shortened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Was it actually based on Hebrew / Semitic languages, or is that simply an impression?"

For example, if you're creating a Slavic language, you could easily use the Cyrillic or Latin scripts (cf. Russian, Czech); there's no need to design a new script.&#xD;&#xA;- What do geographically or lexically similar languages use as their primary scripts? Finnish uses the Latin script as a result of Swedish influence, even though Swedish is not related to Finnish linguistically.&#xD;&#xA;- How does the language intersect with the culture of the people speaking it? Although Serbian and Croatian are technically the same language, they typically use different writing systems because Serbians tend to be Orthodox (Cyrillic-associated) and Croatians tend to be Catholic (Latin-associated). Conversely, Cantonese uses the same script as Mandarin despite not being the same language due to geographical and political similarities.&#xD;&#xA;- When did your language and its script split off from its ancestors, and how were they written? Despite Greek not being a Semitic language, it had a close proximity to the Phoenicians and thus borrowed their alphabet. But if your language came more recently, perhaps you should base it upon a more recent alphabet such as Greek itself, or even the Latin script (as with Lisu).&#xD;&#xA;- How strict is your language phonologically, and what semantic effect does changing vowels or consonants have? Arabic uses an abjad in part because the consonants provide the actual base meaning, while vowels change various minutiae, while Japanese (in part) can use a syllabary because it's very restrictive with syllable structure. On the other hand, Georgian uses a full alphabet because it has so many consonant clusters, which can't really be expressed concisely in a syllabary or abugida.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Then_ you can consider how you want it to look. You can give something a more cursive or angular appearance while still basing it off of something relevant. This also gives it more of a unique flavor even if you're using an existing system. This is something you could do for a Phoenician-based system that doesn't look like Phoenician (crude, but you get the point):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Phoenician aleph; on the right is a symbol that looks like a reversed Latin thorn.][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should additionally think about the direction in which your script is supposed to be written - letter forms can change based on that. They tend to lean right in an LTR script and vice versa, and be either thin and tall or confined to a square for a vertical script (like traditional Mongolian/Uyghur and Chinese hànzì respectively). Also, vertical scripts don't often have completely open bottoms or tops of characters like LTR scripts might.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a fantasy world, where you're relying less on historicity and looking more for inspiration, you kind of just need to look at different scripts applying the sort of aesthetic you want, then alter them and perhaps combine them together into a whole system. If you enjoy neat and somewhat simplistic scripts with varying letter heights, you could combine inspiration from Latin and Armenian. For loopy, natural-looking scripts, take a look at Georgian and Greek. There are tons of different writing systems across the world, and I guarantee you'll find inspiration somewhere if you [look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtpJI.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

All languages (previously) in existence are in essence linear, because they are phonetic representations of human experience. Even when describing the past or the future, language does so in a linear form. Also, any human language is itself subject to time, with one phoneme uttered after another. In addition, the grammars of some languages are very restrictive to allow expression of effect preceding cause, etc. For example, Indo-Germanic languages cannot have verbs without a subject and the subject must precede the verb. So looking at natural languages it is clear that some are better suited to express time paradoxes etc. than others. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Probably the best candidate languages to extend or base a *conlang* on would be those languages that do not change sentence structure for singular vs plural, present vs past or future, affirmative vs negative, certain vs conditional, etc. Japanese for example would be a good candidate. To change all of the aforementioned sentence parameters you would just use suffixes, e.g. *-ta* for past tense, *-tachi* for plural, *-yo* for conditional, etc. It could therefore easily be extended with suffixes to express time paradoxes, timelines, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another language that meets the conditions of unchanging sentence structure related to time &amp; conditions would be Chinese (Literary Chinese to be exact, Modern Chinese would be a bit more problematic due to its compound phrases). This is a monosyllabic language where word meaning is based on tone. Chinese currently has 4 tones. You could add modulations to these tones to express time travel related conditions and effects. But unless you've been brought up in this language it would be extremely hard to learn (just learning to distinguish the current 4 tones in all circumstances is already a daunting task for a non-native speaker unless you're also musically inclined).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to construct a *conlang* that is not based on any existing language, a good candidate would be a language that is based on harmonics (i.e. multiple frequencies uttered at the same time). Different harmonics could represent different time-related states. However, human vocal chords are not really up to the task of uttering complex harmonics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's probably many other ways to answer your question but here's my 2 cents :)" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

However, I’d like to look into it a bit deeper:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Letters**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many (most?) constructed languages are written with the Latin script, i.e. what I’m using right now to write this answer. However, many conlangers find the base set of 26 characters it provides too restrictive, and will make use of things like diacritics (áèñħ…), special characters used in some languages or the IPA (ŋß…) or letters from other alphabets (εφϑ…). This is a choice, and by no means a necessity. Some conlangers, in particular those creating languages for a constructed world, also like to invent entire writing systems and consider the representation with the Latin script (“romanisation”) merely a tool for easy representation online. Again, this is optional, but depending on your goals might be a good idea. It would not make sense to create a new writing system for an auxiliary language though, for example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Words**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There’s three ways one might interpret this question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Do I have to make my words sound different (from English / any other language)? Certainly not: auxiliary languages often take heavy inspiration from existing languages, as familiarity makes it easier to learn a language. Similarly, if you want to toy around with grammar but don’t really care about the actual outcome, you might as well just use placeholder words taken straight from English and focus on what you really care about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Do I have to make words which mean different things than the words in English/any other language? Here I am inclined to say **yes**. If you simply copy an English dictionary and replace all the words by other sounding words, then you’ve created what is called a _relex_. Whether relexes are considered conlangs or not is up for debate, in my eyes they are ciphers. However, there’s layers upon layers to this - is a conlang still a relex if you copy the lexicon but use completely different grammar? Perhaps not, but it’s not as interesting as if you also made a custom lexicon. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that doing so takes away most of what makes a conlang unique. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Do I have to follow the idea of having sentences broken down into words? Absolutely not: it’s actually surprisingly hard (read: an unsolved problem) to define the concept of a word in a way that works for every language. Look into the (just as loosely defined) concept of polysynthesis if you’re intrigued.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sounds**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Language doesn’t have to rely on sound. There’s sign languages as a primary counterexample that also shows up “in real life”, and on top of that, graphical (written only), touch based and many other kinds of languages have been created. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But let’s assume you’re going to be making a spoken language. Two questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Do I have to make _new_ sounds? Well… no. There’s only so many sounds our mouths can make and most of them already occur in some language (and those that don’t, e.g. smacking ones teeth together don’t occur for good reasons), so it’s rather hard to even _make_ new sounds. But if you’re making a language meant for aliens/sapient animals/whatever nonhuman you can come up with, then maybe you might want to. But many conlangers don’t bother, as it is _really hard_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Do I have to make a new sound system or can I just use the sounds of English/other language? Same point as with the words above: You don’t have to, and if your goal is to focus on other parts of the conlang you might as well ignore it, but if your goal is to make a good, interesting and unique conlang, then… yea you should.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Summary**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, what you do and don’t do depends entirely on your design goals. If you wanna toy with a particular grammar concept, then focus on the essentials. If you wanna make the new big international auxlang then keep things familiar to the target audience. If you want to make a natural looking conlang, then go all in and be creative." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It's also noteworthy that it lacks plurals, a decidedly un-English-like feature. Both these features were likely inspired by Mandarin Chinese.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Glosa also has an article that is unspecified for definiteness, using *u(n)* for both &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a(n)&quot;, which is a departure from its major influences -- English, which has distinct definite and indefinite articles; Mandarin Chinese, which doesn't have any such articles; and Esperanto, which possesses one explicitly definite article. However, this article's syntactic behavior does not seem notably different from the English or Esperanto articles, so it's not thinking too far outside the box there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could definitely argue that Glosa's departures from English are pretty small, and that it's thus still quite relex-y in spirit.

Text="*Revised answer:*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a maxim of geopoesy: ***who makes the world makes the rules***. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a secondary world, a world of your own devising, an invented language would not need to &quot;enforce&quot; subjective idealism at all.  Only one thing is required, and that is to &quot;set the dial&quot; of your subcreation to subjective idealism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In *that* world, only the mind and mental constructs have true existence. The language a mind devises for itself to communicate (within itself) and assuming the mind that exists is a human mind, will arise to describe its experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think your semantic primes would probably be sufficient to describe both the *realia* of the mind-being's existence: the 1s pronoun, the concrete verbs such as &quot;think&quot;, &quot;know&quot; and &quot;believe&quot;, the qualia of phantasms created within the mind. Because sunsets and wine do not exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the world you subcreate is, in actuality, a typological copy of the primary world, where things outside the mind have actual existence, then you run into the exact same issues I dealt with when your question was about the primary world itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such a language, I hold, would not be able to &quot;enforce&quot; subjective idealism in any meaningful way. It would not be able to overcome the steak and eggs problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Original response to unedited query (regarding subjective idealism within the primary world) retained for historical purposes:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Subjective idealism is the monistic metaphysical doctrine that only minds and mental contents exist.

Subjective idealism rejects dualism, neutral monism, and materialism.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*How could my to be constructed language be restricted to such view of reality?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A very interesting thought experiment! But I believe is simply not practicable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think a language of any kind will be able to enforce that kind of (quite silly) perspective of reality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to pull it off, I think you would have to first, absolutely and positively convince yourself that [Berkeley][1] was a) on to something and b) that a) is The Something.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, reason and common sense inform us that things do actually exist. Things outside the mind, things outside of mental construct. I can sit my weary bones down on a chair and be thankful that chairs exist. They're not mental constructs.  They're articles of furniture made of wood and designed and built to be sat in. That's reason and common sense refuting Berkeley.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I had a look at Mr Berkeley's picture in that article. He looks pretty well fed to me.  Not emaciated, not dehydrated. I'll just bet he enjoyed a good steak and eggs for breakfast!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A true subjective idealist would also have to be a [practical breatharian][2], because food does not exist. It's an insubstantial construct of the mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For your language to really function, you too would have to become a breatharian. You know: immerse yourself in the culture! Let us know how far you get in the practical application of this kind of philosophical language!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specific to your last point re objects: I think, since objects do not exist and are therefore irrelevant to the thought and being of the mind, you could probably get away with a language where all substantives (apart from the 1s) are reduced to a single pronominal stem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trees don't exist, so you wouldn't really need a word for &quot;tree&quot;.

Rather, languages with 'free' word order use the rearrangements to signify additional meaning. Here, look at English:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hey, what did you eat?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a plain question, indicated by shifting the 'what' from its underlying position to the front.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Wait, you ate what?!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the perspective of a logician, this sentence should mean the same thing, right? But it doesn't. When you don't shift a wh-word, it doesn't remain a question, it's a statement of surprise and maybe a request for clarification. It's also stylistically informal, and wouldn't be used in a sentence. In other words, it's what linguists call a 'pragmatic shift'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Every* language with 'free' word order does something like this. Traditional grammar and logic tends to downplay or be unaware of word order and pragmatics, and so people who speak such languages tend to believe that words can be arranged in any which way you want. But underlyingly, every arrangement of word order carries a stylistic or pragmatic significance, and using the 'wrong' arrangement will make it sound off to a fluent speaker, even if they couldn't explain why.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto is an interesting example -- officially speaking, Esperanto has totally free word order. But in practice, Esperanto word orderings follow unspoken stylistic and pragmatic rules (typically lifted from Germanic and Slavic). So this would presumably occur with any fluently spoken language, conlang or not." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is common for languages to have more than one of these, and to my knowledge all free word order natural languages have either case or verbal agreement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# [Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Case refers to grammatical markers attached to nouns which indicate the noun's role in the sentence. Some languages have a very large number of cases, but in general you can expect such a language to have at least two cases: nominative and accusative, or ergative and absolutive. Here is an example from [Walmajarri](http://www.ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%202_0.pdf):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    parri-ngu  pa   manga-Ø   nyanya&#xD;&#xA;    boy-subj   AUX  girl-obj  saw&#xD;&#xA;    'The boy saw the girl.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    parri-Ø  pa   nyanya  manga-ngu&#xD;&#xA;    boy-obj  AUX  saw     girl-subj&#xD;&#xA;    'The girl saw the boy.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Walmajarri `ngu` is the ergative case marker. Walmajarri has a null absolutive case marker, shown here as `Ø`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# [Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second strategy is agreement, where markers are attached to the verb to give information about the subject and object. Depending on the language, these markers might indicate the person, number, or gender of each noun. Here's an example, again from [Walmajarri](http://ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%201_0.pdf):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    nayili  nya-ka-kyaka-ji-pila&#xD;&#xA;    north   see-IRR-REDUP-1sgO-3dlS&#xD;&#xA;    'You two watch out for me in the north.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here the verb has two suffixes (actually clitics), `-ji` and `-pila`, which mean a 1st person singular object, and a 3rd person dual subject. While it is most common for these verbal agreement markers to be attached to the verbs, in some languages they are attached to other elements in the sentence. In Walmajarri the most common sentence form actually has these markers attaching to a modal auxiliary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ngayirta  ma-rnalu     majurra  kang-ka-rla&#xD;&#xA;    NEG       AUX-1plincS  matches  carry-IRR-PAST&#xD;&#xA;    'We didn't take matches.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here `ma` is the unmarked modal auxiliary, to which `-rnalu` is attached, the marker for a 1st person plural inclusive subject. Matches is a third person singular object and so has a null marker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# [Incorporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(linguistics))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The third strategy is incorporation, where a language productively forms compound words where the verb includes the object. English doesn't do this very productively - our compounds are more like individual set combinations. So in the verb *babysit* the object *baby* is incorporated, but the meaning of the compound is not obviously derived from its component parts. In incorporating languages this process happens productively with the components often keeping their normal sense. Here is an example from [Nuu-chah-nulth](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom093/full):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    maḥt'a-ʔa-mit-ʔiš    čakup	 &#xD;&#xA; 	house-buy-past-3ind  man	 &#xD;&#xA; 	'A man bought a house.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 	ʔu-ʔaa-mit-ʔiš    maḥt'ii  čakup&#xD;&#xA; 	Ø-buy-past-3.ind  house    man&#xD;&#xA; 	'A man bought a house.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nuu-chah-nulth is called an obligatory incorporating language because if the object is not incorporated a dummy morpheme `ʔu` must be used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now while incorporation is used in many languages, we have to be careful about making generalisations as each language incorporates nouns according to its own rules. Some incorporate adjectives, and some don't. Or for example, in [Nahuatl](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom093/full) an independent noun indicates a specific event, whereas an incorporated noun indicates a more general or habitual meaning:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ni-c-qua  in   nacatl&#xD;&#xA;    I-it-eat  the  flesh&#xD;&#xA;    'I eat the flesh.' [particular act]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ni-naca-qua&#xD;&#xA;    I-flesh-eat&#xD;&#xA;    'I eat flesh' or 'I am a flesh-eater.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A free word order conlang could require incorporation of all objects and not use either case or agreement, a typological combination that does not exist in natlangs to my knowledge."

Common design goals of an auxiliary language are *ease of learning* and *simplicity of use*.  These goals are best met when vocabulary and grammar are familiar to the target audience.  This is why [Interlingua][3] and [Esperanto][4] are considered &quot;easy&quot; languages to learn and have gained considerable user communities, with Esperanto boasting a small community of native level speakers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What you're describing, a completely [a priori][5] invented language is most usually the domain of the [artistic language][6], the [engineered language][7] and the [philosophical language][8]. With the exception of the philosophical inventors, most glossopoets are not interested in propagandising their languages as auxiliary languages.  Occasionally a philosophical language inventor will propose his language as a means of general communication, but this is usually done from a position of ignorance as to how language works (accomplished auxiliary language proponents are usually quite well aware how language works in the wild!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Auxiliary languages tend not to be classified as a priori simply because they impose layers of difficulty that run contrary to the usual design parameters of the genre. However, it can potentially be argued that a priori invented languages can become auxiliary languages after a fashion and if the appropriate stars align. For example, it may be that Klingon has seen some use as an ad hoc auxiliary language if, for example, two groups of Star Trek fans who do not share a language in common other than Klingon happen to meet at a SciFi convention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Needless to say, even if there were an actual auxiliary language that is classified as purely a priori, it certainly isn't famous.

If there are multiple clauses in a complex sentence, you will need to mark the clause boundaries in some way, eg through punctuation or use of specific conjunctions. So you can put anything in that place, and it will be interpreted as a verb: _'Ono_ means &quot;delicious&quot; as an adjective, in _'Ono ka hua moa_ it is used as a verb to mean &quot;the egg is delicious&quot;. That also might solve problems when you later grow your lexicon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Markers: In toki pona, the verb is always in second position in a clause, and is separated from the subject (which is in first position) through the particle _li_. So the sentence _waso li lape_ can be parsed as _waso_ - subject, _lape_ - verb, even if you have no clue what the words actually mean (&quot;bird&quot; and &quot;to sleep&quot; respectively) Note: the personal pronouns _mi_ ans _sina_ are an exception to this rule, as they are not followed by _li_. _Lape_ can also be a noun (&quot;the sleep&quot;). Transitive verbs are separated by _e_ from the object, which again helps identifying the sentence structure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Morphology: if you want to avoid repetitive sounds, you can nominate different verb endings (or prefixes) to either introduce variation for variation's sake, or to indicate other features (number, tense, aspect, modality, ...) While Esperanto uses a limited set of verb endings indicating (mostly) tense, it does not sound repetitive. If your verbs are not marked for grammatical features, morphology obviously is not an option." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

You can create variation by retaining some archaic features, applying changes from different descendants, or applying changes in different temporal order to create a new artificial Goidelic language.

So, a sentence like &quot;the woman sees the man&quot;, could be roughly translated to something like &quot;the woman**s** see the man&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This type of sentence shows an ergative-absolutive morphosyntactic alignment: the subject of a transitive sentence is marked (ergative case), while the direct object is unmarked (absolutive case).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also like the idea of **removing verbs as a class (since tense, aspect and mood can be expressed by the subject**) and &quot;reclassify&quot; those words as nouns. So &quot;the woman**s** see the man&quot; could actually mean something like &quot;the woman *makes sight of* the man&quot;, in the sense of &quot;making eye contact&quot;. In other words, having **ungrammaticalized verbs**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, the actual translation for &quot;the woman sees the man&quot; would be &quot;the woman**s** sight the man&quot;. And that's the problem: &quot;sight&quot; and &quot;man&quot; are both unmarked nouns, leading to misinterpretation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So my question is: **does the language need a marking for the direct object** (accusative case), having then a tripartite alignment? Or can I simply get away with **only TAM marking** (absolutive case) and **no markings for verbs or direct objects**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have the feeling that I'm forgetting something. I think that the idea of &quot;not having verbs&quot; makes sense to me, since many languages like English, French or Spanish actually lack of inflections and employ only word order, but I might be wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think?

Rosenfelder describes the book as &quot;a tour of modern syntax&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being a linguist myself, it looks like the book I'd loved to have had while at university. It covers (English) syntactic theory in a way that looks interesting and not simply dry and theoretical -- he supplements the book by a set of interactive tools to develop your own grammars based on the theoretical ideas of Chomsky and others. He does follow a particular strand of syntactic theory, which is mainly common in the US, not so much in the UK, but he also covers some alternatives to the Chomskyan approach. Rosenfelder's own view of Chomsky is nuanced and somewhat sceptical: he has an essay on this on his website (which I wholeheartedly agree with). Note, however, that this is about English, and these formalisms have been developed by linguists working mostly with English, so if your conlang is very different, they might not easily apply to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from Chomskyan [Generative Grammar][2], he also talks about [Markov text generators][3], which would be useful to generate (random) texts in a given language. This might be a useful tool to practically explore your conlang: generate some text, and try to translate it. Several other tools are also aimed at generating sentences, rather than just analysing them. The meaning is often a bit random (as it is not really controlled), but at least the grammar will be correct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So this is basically a syntax textbook, which will introduce you to syntactic theories while playing around with the formalisms and actively doing syntax (which to me is the best way of learning about them!) If you are interested in grammar, and the formal properties of different types of grammars, this looks like an ideal book. In fact, I have put it on my wishlist with a well-known on-line book retailer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if all you want to do is build a smallish conlang, which might not even have a very complicated grammar, then this book looks like overkill to me. On the site he mentions that there is &quot;a chapter on how you can apply all this to your conlangs&quot;. So conlangs are not really the focus of the book, but more a possible application of the described syntactic apparatus to invented languages. I would assume -- from the description on the webpage -- that this is a fairly advanced book, which is great for linguistics students and  for serious conlangers who want to make use of sophisticated formalisms when describing their languages. In that sense it will not cover too much of the same ground as his more 'applied'/'practical' books about language creation. If the previous books have kindled an interest in linguistics, though, and you want to know more about approaches to syntactic description, then this might be the book for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://zompist.com/syntax.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://zompist.com/markov.html" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you want to actually use it and keep it independent of other languages, I suggest keeping it simple - a movie language, for instance, is more effectful if you only choose in-character sounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Btw, you get a lot more sounds even in English and Italian if you include unusual words, regional dialects and so on - a large part of the IPA phonemes can be used in either language, though people often don't notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here a few different English vowels (all mainstream):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hut&#xD;&#xA;Hat&#xD;&#xA;Heroic&#xD;&#xA;Hellenic&#xD;&#xA;Hmmmh&#xD;&#xA;Hit&#xD;&#xA;Here&#xD;&#xA;Hot&#xD;&#xA;Hotel&#xD;&#xA;Herd&#xD;&#xA;Hoover&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alpha&#xD;&#xA;And&#xD;&#xA;Entity&#xD;&#xA;About&#xD;&#xA;e-in-Garden&#xD;&#xA;India&#xD;&#xA;Equal&#xD;&#xA;Oven&#xD;&#xA;Organ&#xD;&#xA;Earth&#xD;&#xA;Ultra&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Iron&#xD;&#xA;Out&#xD;&#xA;Able&#xD;&#xA;Oil&#xD;&#xA;Over&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hi&#xD;&#xA;How&#xD;&#xA;Hey&#xD;&#xA;Hoist&#xD;&#xA;Holy&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's 32 distinct sounds. Some might be debatable, they are also dependent on dialect - &quot;and&quot; and &quot;entity&quot; start with the same sound for some, but I hear a difference - at least in some regions. The e in &quot;Garden&quot; isn't a sound at all according to some. And so on. The version on Wikipedia (English phonology) is slightly different. &quot;Ha&quot; is even in IPA written as two sounds, though it clearly is one sound (a whispered &quot;a&quot;), as you can see when stretching it, with or without adding a letter afterwards. I even ommitted a few vowels only the British/Australian/Canadian people use. According to Google, US English has 14-16 vowel phonemes, Australian English 20-21. And the whispered variety isn't even included. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you multiply by three for tonal (add Up like we do in questions and Down like we do in some forms of emphasis or sounding defeated), you get 96. Asia also has a wavering tonal, but that can be emulated with two letters imo.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you multiply by two for 2 different lengths, you get 192. If we ignore the h-sounds, we are still at 96.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what you have is not that much." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It recommends phrasing things in such a way as to always be objectively true. That boils down to expressing observations without judgment (e.g. &quot;the sky is blue&quot;) and substituting judgmental expressions with expressions of inner emotions, basic needs, and requests.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's hard to capture the breadth of the theory behind it (I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWb2B2uPfMo) if you're interested), so I'll give a few examples of what it argues for and against:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The violent way of putting things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;You're an idiot&quot; (judgment)&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;I feel taken advantage of&quot; (not an emotion, but rather a judgment)&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;You make me angry&quot; (it's one's own mind that creates anger, not a person)&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;I need you to go away.&quot; (&quot;you to go away&quot; is not a basic need; needs in general should not involve specific people)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The nonviolent way of putting things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;When you said 'You're an idiot', I felt angry.&quot; (expressing an observation and a past emotion)&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;When I think about you saying 'You're an idiot', I feel angry.&quot; (expressing an observation and a current emotion)&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;I feel angry, because I'm needing understanding&quot; (expressing the need behind the emotion)&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;I'm needing peace and quiet. Would you be willing to leave the room?&quot; (expressing a basic need without referencing a specific person)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**So how can this translate to a constructed language?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Get rid of judgmental words.** Get rid of words like &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, and &quot;ugly&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;- **Get rid of the word &quot;feel&quot;, use verbs for emotions.** That's to avoid using the word feel in cases where it's not an actual emotion that one's expressing (like feeling &quot;taken advantage of&quot;). The verbs should be intransitive, as to get rid of the idea that something external is responsible for a person's emotions.&#xD;&#xA;- **Have a rich vocabulary of emotional words.** [Here](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/feelings-inventory)'s a list to get you started.&#xD;&#xA;- **Center the language around basic needs.** [Here's a list of needs](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory) for reference. Remember that basic needs never involve specific people, actions or things. (Those should be included in observations and requests.)&#xD;&#xA;- **Have most expressions stick to the four components of NVC: observations, emotions, basic needs, and specific requests.** Sentences might be variations on the form &quot;When I [see/hear/smell/...] [observation], I feel [emotion], because I'm needing [basic needs]. Would you be willing to [request]?&quot; (All components are optional, one can use any subset.) See [this page](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/aboutnvc/4partprocess.htm) for details."

There isn't a plosive-like sound for stopping air flowing through the nose, as there is with the mouth (in multiple places). The way you can test this is by producing a sound like /aãaãaãa/, in which you are repeatedly stopping the nasal airflow, and yet the vowel sound remains continuous because there is no stop of air in the mouth. So a stop created solely by blocking the nasal passage is impossible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The example you give for this sound is [ĩɲ't̚?ⁿn̩], where the [?] is supposed to represent the unknown sound. This has a [t̚] with the diacritic for no release after the consonant, and a nasal release [ⁿ] after it. However, there can't possibly be anything between [t̚] and [ⁿ]. The [t̚] means that when the consonant ends, you are still blocking both oral and nasal airflow, and the [ⁿ] means that you are releasing nasal airflow while keeping oral airflow closed. There is no articulation possible in between these: if there were an oral release, the diacritic on [t̚] would have no meaning, and there could no longer be a nasal release [ⁿ] after it. The only possibility is to add another consonant, or extend the [t] as a long consonant [tː], which continues to block all airflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Going through your definition, [nasal release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_release) seems to fit (another possibility that fits just as well is a [pre-stopped nasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-stopped_consonant), if the nasal consonant is supposed to be more prominent than the stop):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This stop is formed by stopping air from flowing into the nasal cavity with the velum &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stopping airflow is a property of a stop consonant. A stop consonant stops the airflow in the mouth as well as the airflow in the nasal cavity. (Stopping only the airflow in the nasal cavity is impossible here, as explained above.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;while the mouth is in position to form the following consonant&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simultaneous articulation is possible, but it depends on what the following consonant is. If the following consonant is in the same place of articulation, that means there's no change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;and then releasing it into the nasal cavity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Releasing the stop only in the nasal cavity means producing a nasal sound. Nasal release (and nasals in general) would continue to block the airflow in the mouth, but allow it to pass through the nose." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A Toki Pona clause can have more than one predicate. `li` never marks a non-predicate. It also appears on every predicate except when that predicate _is the first one in the clause and the subject is_ exactly _`mi` or_ exactly _`sina`_ (101) or when preceded by the vocative/imperative particle `o` (102).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think a good way to analyze this would be to say that every indicative predicate obligatorily has a predicate marker, but sometimes it's null.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    mi  moku  li   pakala. (101)&#xD;&#xA;    I   food  LI  mistake.&#xD;&#xA;    I eat and destroy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    o   lukin     e    ni. (102)&#xD;&#xA;    IMP   see  DObj  that.&#xD;&#xA;    watch this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a fragment of (my best guess of) the Toki Pona grammar. I haven't seen any examples of stacking imperative phrases, so I don't know whether _look and say_ would be `o lukin li toki` or `o lukin o toki`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, in Toki Pona verb phrases and noun phrases are different syntactically. For instance, `*sina moku e soweli ala soweli.` cannot be used to mean _are you a vegetarian_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    LI        := 0 | &quot;li&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    PredInd   := LI VP {PP} | LI NP&#xD;&#xA;    ClauseInd := NP [PredInd]&#xD;&#xA;    PredImp   := &quot;o&quot; VP {PP} | &quot;o&quot; NP&#xD;&#xA;    ClauseImp := NP PredImp | PredImp&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;I'm not thrilled with this analysis because of the asymmetry between indicative and imperative clauses. Unifying the clause types, however, would predict that `*li moku.` is valid. As far as I can tell, Toki Pona does not permit null subjects in indicative clauses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can think of two potential alternative analyses for `li`: A) it's a pronoun (like in Example 4 Longgu [on this WALS article][1] or B) it's a preposition.  I'll try to show that both of those analyses lead to bad predictions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A) `li` as pronoun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This falls apart for a couple of reasons. It predicts that `mi moku li pakala` would be invalid and that the correct form would be `mi moku mi pakala`. In reality, both forms are fine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`li` as a pronoun also predicts that `*li moku` would be valid since it would contain an explicit subject under that analysis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, `*mi moku li.` cannot be used to mean _I eat it_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;B) `li` as preposition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If `li` were a preposition, (103) and (104) would both be valid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Mi pakala e moku.

Here's a suggestion: Add a particle *ye* meaning roughly &quot;like&quot; to your proto-language, and the phrase *pfufi ye* will fill the role of an adverb. It is easy to conceive, that *pfufi ye* evolves to *pfufe* by just dropping one syllable ([syncope][2]).

But there are clearly identifyable influences of other languages, both constructed and natural.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's start with the catch phrase *valar morghulis* from GRRM: It just sounds like Tolkien's Elvish languages, with *valar* being a word from [Quenya][1] and *morghul* a word from [Sindarin][2]. Both Quenya and Sindarin have [well-known influences from natural languages][3]: Finnish for Quenya and Welsh for Sindarin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at High Valyrian, some Finnish feeling is still retained in the language: There is a distinction between long and short consonants as well as vowels, the case endings still have some Finnish feel (and a Latin feel, too, especially the vowel alternations), the phonotactics resemble Finnish. It is further away from Finnish than Quenya in its phonology contrasting voiced and voiceless stops and featuring the sound /q/. There is little Welsh in High Valyrian left, maybe the frequency of [&quot;the defining fantasy vowel&quot; ae][4] (Laura Wattenberg) can be traced to Welsh.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 8-case system may be insprired by Languages like Russian or Sanskrit, with the commitative case being typologically rare, but occurring in Finnish again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The four noun classes are a creative invention (but not far of, as natural language, especially Native American languages, are concerned) and I see no closer resemblence to Bantu languages (they have a lot of noun classes, but the noun classes are marked by overt prefixes that are also used as agreement markers).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The syntax with head-final relative clauses may be inspired by languages like Japanese.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. While Peterson has stated some [linguistic influences for the Dothraki language][5], I have not found a similar quote for Valyrian. So all the observations above are mine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/1/were-tolkiens-elvish-languages-based-on-known-natural-languages&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2011/9/the-women-of-fantasy-context-free-femininity-part-2&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://dothraki.conlang.org/official-hbo-press-release/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If it is &quot;I can see bears and metal drums&quot;, then you would have to repeat the subject and verb, effectively saying &quot;I can see bears and I can see metal drums&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As per The Klingon Dictionary (6.2, _Complex Sentences_): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When the subject of both the joined sentences is the same, the English translation may be reduced to a less choppy form, but Klingon does not allow this shortening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are just talking about lists of items without having a complex sentence, then I would think this sentence from 5.3 (_Conjunctions_) applies (even though it is about the post-verbal meaning of _je_):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As in English, the meaning of such sentences is ambiguous: [..] The exact meaning is determined by context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there are bears and metal drums, then presumably you're not talking about bears, metal, and drums. An oft-quoted example where there is an ambiguity in English is _I am dedicating this work to my parents, the Queen of England and the Archbishop of Canterbury_. Without a comma before _and_, the list could be mistaken for an apposition. Obviously, the context makes this interpretation highly unlikely!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just remember that language is rarely unambiguous and independent of context; any attempts to avoid this make it very unwieldy.

An example for a human sublanguage would be the language of recipes. Words that have multiple meanings in English generally have only one specific meaning in a sublanguage. The syntactic structures are simplified, and often different from general English. Certain aspects of the range of human expressions are left out or limited (you might talk about emotions or feelings, but they would only relate to the food mentioned).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could design a programming language that is suited to expressing recipes, and it could be used to drive a cooking robot. That programming language could also be read by humans, who would understand the meaning of it, and could translate it into other languages. In this sense 'programming language' is a bit of a red herring: it's just a formal representation of meaning. And (propositional) meaning can easily be expressed in [predicate calculus][3] or related formalisms. Is [CD representation][4] a conlang, or just an abstract representation of actions/states? It can certainly be transformed into any number of other languages (natural or constructed), and it can express a reasonable range of human activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where do you draw the line? At what point does a constructed language cross the boundary between being simply a mark-up or programming language to being suitable for human communication? What is the essence that, say, HTML, is missing, but that [toki pona][5], [Klingon][6], or Esperanto have? Note: I'm not suggesting that HTML is a conlang, but it can be used to encode a specific kind of meaning, and XML can even [encode semantic relationships][7]. But they might not be very suitable for inter-human communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could, though, envisage two people with no common language between them who use a programming language to work together on solving a problem. It would be tough, but should be possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my view there is a continuum between 'fully formed' languages on the one hand, and restricted or sublanguages on the other. While it is difficult to formally represent the more complex languages (because they are so complex), the simpler end of the spectrum can be encoded in such a representation. Predicate calculus is one representation, and any programming language is another one. There is no hard boundary between the two, so in a way (even though nobody would really 'speak' in a programming language) the answer is: yes, programming languages can be categorised as conlangs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/devil%27s_advocate&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublanguage&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_dependency_theory&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The intention is for them to be received by aliens, who will be able to use them to find out about human culture (and then hopefully won't come over to subjugate us with their superior technology!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They use lots of universal physical and mathematical quantities as references, and with the understanding that any sufficiently advanced society will be able to identify them. For example the molecular structure of hydrogen, and a diagram of the solar system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So one key element for easy decipherability would be to have texts available describing something universally known across the universe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another would be to have a simple writing system. [Hangul][3] is based on the positions of the vocal tract, which would be an aid for deciphering. It is somewhat complicated by combining multiple symbols in blocks, similarly to Egyptian hieroglyphs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A simple grammar like [toki pona][4] would help to quickly discover regularities in the language. There are separators between the verb and the object, and there is usually only one verb per sentence. Complex sentences are broken down into a sequence of multiple sentences. Even without understanding the words, it is easy to identify the syntactic structures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Texts could be formulaic in structure. One clue that helped decipher German messages encoded with the [Enigma machine][5] was their fixed structure, and the fact that they always ended in the same phrase, &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; -- that served as a useful anchor point when trying to work out the code. If your alien texts also have a similar structure, then you could use that to identify greetings or other formulaic expressions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most difficult aspect would be the vocabulary, especially abstract words, or polysemous words (ie words with multiple meanings). For this simple texts, or even encyclopedias and (monolingual) dictionaries would provide a good entrance point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most human languages follow certain quantitative regularities, which we now know about. There has been some work on the [Phaistos Disc][6] which concluded that if it is a text in an unknown language, it is most likey to use a syllabic writing system, ie the symbols stand for syllables rather than letters. This can be derived from the frequency distribution of the symbols. Of course it might not be a text -- my pet hypothesis is that it is part of a board game :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, there are a number of aspects you could take into account for this. With what we know about languages and their properties nowadays, it should be quite convincing for a space mission to have a linguist as part of their team who could work on deciphering any foreign languages without too many problems. Of course it would also depend how close the alien culture was to human cultures. Language is only part of the puzzle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos_Disc" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Suppose English had multiple third person singular pronouns, such that you didn't just have &quot;she&quot;, but &quot;she-1&quot;, &quot;she-2&quot;, and perhaps more. Then what does the example look like?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-2.&quot; - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-1.&quot; - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No ambiguity. The context makes it clear that Mary is she-1 (Mary had the ball, she-1 threw the ball, therefore Mary is she-1, so Susan is she-2).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third option is context. You might have a language where you do need to gather more information in order to determine what's going on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan threw it back.&quot; - Mary obviously threw the ball to Susan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan then asked for the ball.&quot; - Mary apparently didn't throw the ball to Susan, since Susan asked for it after it had been thrown and caught.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, three possible ways to get away without reflexive pronouns. So it's not a matter of how common or uncommon it is, but does the grammar of the language allow you to get away without them, or is it necessary because there's no other way of providing the same information?"

About a decade ago, an article in a newspaper talked about the Chinese city of Shenyang but hyphenated it *Sheny-ang*. From a German point of view that could have been an acceptable syllable grouping if y is considered a vowel as *ya* (or *ia*) is not an acceptable diphthong, but *Shen-yang* (y as a half-vowel) would also have worked. For Chinese, only *Shen-yang* is possible because of the very restricted set of syllables. In Japanese, *Shen-yan(g)* or *She-nyan(g)* (strictly speaking, Japanese doesn’t have an ng sound unless k or g follow) would be possible with a y in the spelling; *She-ni-an(g)* or *Shen-i-an(g)* would strictly require an i in there.&#xA;&#xA;As you maybe see, what will be seen depends on the language, and only what is possible will be produced. Another example is Japanese again, which only has open syllables or those ending in n. So when a Japanese tries to pronounce *startling*, that tends to end up somewhere near *sutartolingu*, a five-syllable (seven-mora) word. Thus, a speaker of your conlang will not even consider *ep-se* a possibility but will default to *e-pse*, if that is all the language does.&#xA;&#xA;For the record, some languages with loose syllable rules still tend to end up with ambiguity. For example, the Finnish place Yli-Ii will have to have a hyphen to signify the short-long sequence. The German word *Bakterien* has an unusual syllable boundary between i and e (*Bak-te-ri-en*) while *ie* usually just signifies a long /i/ sound. Those things will need to be learnt at school, there is no way to predict." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Assume English had no reflexives. &quot;I tossed the ball to I&quot; and &quot;You tossed the ball to you&quot; (assuming singular &quot;you&quot;) are quite understandable as one person tossing the ball to themselves, thus no reflexive needed. &quot;She tossed the ball to he&quot;, acceptable. But suppose you had &quot;She tossed the ball to she&quot;, and it's been previously established there is more than one woman present. Did person A throw the ball to Person B, or did she toss the ball up in the air and caught it herself? There's no way to tell. An example like that is why German only has a distinctive reflexive in third person; first and second person don't have that same ambiguity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can get rid of the reflexive entirely if your verb system, to use one possibility, allows a given verb to indicate if it takes a direct or indirect object, or if it does not. Let's say that English verbs used the affix *a-* to indicate the verb is ditransitive (it has both a direct and indirect object) and no affix to indicate purely transitive (it only has a direct object).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She a-threw the ball to she.&quot; - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she.&quot; - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Under a system like that, English wouldn't need a reflexive pronoun because the verb would make it clear whether the subject was performing the action on themselves, or using themselves as the indirect object, or whether something else was the recipient of the action. One could argue the affix *a-* is similar to the single Icelandic reflexive pronoun that's used for everything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Inuktitut, verbs that are are equivalent to English intransitive verbs use one suffix attached to them to indicate the subject:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pisuk *to walk*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pisuktunga *I am walking*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pisuktutit *You (singular) are walking*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pisuktuq *He/She/It is walking*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specific verbs, equivalent to transitive verbs, use a different set of suffixes that indicate both subject and object:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiq *to shoot something*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtagit *I shoot you*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtara *I shoot him/her/it*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtarma *You shoot me*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtait *You shoot him/her/it*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtaanga *He/she/it shoot me*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtaatit *He/she/it shoot you*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtanga *He/she/it shoot that other he/she/it*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's where the reflexives come in: if you don't use the second set of suffixes, but instead use the first set, then the verb becomes a reflexive: the subject did something to themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtunga *I shoot myself*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtutit *You shoot yourself*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtuq *He/She/It shoot themself*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Attaching the suffix that goes on intransitive verbs onto a transitive verb turns that verb into a reflexive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if your verb conjugation allows that sort of thing, then you can get away with not using reflexive pronouns. The verb indicates it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, if your verb doesn't allow you to do that, then you need reflexives in order to remove the ambiguity when you get into situations where it's not clear who is doing what to whom. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another way: go back to that first English example I used. Suppose English had multiple third person singular pronouns, such that you didn't just have &quot;she&quot;, but &quot;she-1&quot;, &quot;she-2&quot;, and perhaps more. Then what does the example look like?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-2.&quot; - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-1.&quot; - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No ambiguity. The context makes it clear that Mary is she-1 (Mary had the ball, she-1 threw the ball, therefore Mary is she-1, so Susan is she-2).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third option is context. You might have a language where you do need to gather more information in order to determine what's going on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan threw it back.&quot; - Mary obviously threw the ball to Susan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan then asked for the ball.&quot; - Mary apparently didn't throw the ball to Susan, since Susan asked for it after it had been thrown and caught.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, three possible ways to get away without reflexive pronouns. So it's not a matter of how common or uncommon it is, but does the grammar of the language allow you to get away without them, or is it necessary because there's no other way of providing the same information?"

At least, find those letters that are used by &quot;only one country&quot;! Such as some letters in Greek alphabets (As far as I know, Greek are the only country that use Greek alphabets).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, I think it's better to divide that alphabets into 2 group. First group are those letters that &quot;every people in every country know how to pronounce&quot;. I think it's good to base it on Japanese, because Japanese has the least amount of pronunciations as far as I know. I believe they are the easiest language to learn pronunciation-wise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This group of letters build up the &quot;basic and conceptual words&quot;, where all other words are the &quot;combination product&quot; of these words. You can think it as the &quot;building block&quot; of the words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, I think it's better to make the words &quot;a word a syllable&quot; such as Chinese. And 1-syllable words made from the &quot;Basic letters&quot; are the &quot;building block&quot; of the words. More complicated words are the combination of these &quot;basic conceptual words&quot;. Such as &quot;Refrigerator&quot; are actually &quot;Electronic Ice Box&quot; in Chinese.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also think it's better to make the letters &quot;phonetic&quot;! 'A' is always pronounced 'a' NO MATTER WHAT! Unlike English, 'A' has 2 million ways of pronunciation!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second group of letters are those pronunciations that &quot;All the countries in the world that **COULD EVER MADE**! I know this might sounds like far fetching, but the idea is &quot;Easy for everybody to learn such language. And for those who are familiar with the language, it will be easy for them to learn **EVERY LANGUAGE**&quot;!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can think it as &quot;The first group letters are the intersection of the pronunciations of every language, and the second group are the union of the pronunciations of every language&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the second group of letters are only used for those more advanced, probably grammatical, concepts. Which is &quot;Unnecessary for basic conversations but critical for literature&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, my question is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Is such ideas feasible!?

On the flip side, everybody then has to learn the letters and how to pronounce them, which makes your language harder to learn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your question you also touch on morphology: that is a whole different field, which you should probably put in a separate question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* each language has an inventory of sounds it uses, these are called [_phonemes_][3].&#xD;&#xA;* phonemes are represented in writing by letters; this is not a 1:1 mapping, and also&#xD;&#xA;depends on accents and dialectal variation.&#xD;&#xA;* Letters can have diacritics (such as the dots on top of the _&amp;uuml;_) &amp;mdash; these usually make them separate letters from the base form.&#xD;&#xA;* the letter-phoneme mapping is arbitrary; there is nothing inherent in the letter that determines how it should be pronounced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general I would recommend that you read up on some of the concepts of linguistics, as that would make it easier for you to express what exactly you want to achieve. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

At least, find those letters that are used by &quot;only one country&quot;! Such as some letters in Greek alphabets (As far as I know, Greek are the only country that use Greek alphabets).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, I think it's better to divide that alphabets into 2 group. First group are those letters that &quot;every people in every country know how to pronounce&quot;. I think it's good to base it on Japanese, because Japanese has the least amount of pronunciations as far as I know. I believe they are the easiest language to learn pronunciation-wise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This group of letters build up the &quot;basic and conceptual words&quot;, where all other words are the &quot;combination product&quot; of these words. You can think it as the &quot;building block&quot; of the words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, I think it's better to make the words &quot;a word a syllable&quot; such as Chinese. And 1-syllable words made from the &quot;Basic letters&quot; are the &quot;building block&quot; of the words. More complicated words are the combination of these &quot;basic conceptual words&quot;. Such as &quot;Refrigerator&quot; are actually &quot;Electronic Ice Box&quot; in Chinese.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also think it's better to make the letters &quot;phonetic&quot;! 'A' is always pronounced 'a' NO MATTER WHAT! Unlike English, 'A' has 2 million ways of pronunciation!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second group of letters are those pronunciations that &quot;All the countries in the world that **COULD EVER MADE**! I know this might sounds like far fetching, but the idea is &quot;Easy for everybody to learn such language. And for those who are familiar with the language, it will be easy for them to learn **EVERY LANGUAGE**&quot;!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can think it as &quot;The first group letters are the intersection of the pronunciations of every language, and the second group are the union of the pronunciations of every language&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the second group of letters are only used for those more advanced, probably grammatical, concepts. Which is &quot;Unnecessary for basic conversations but critical for literature&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, my question is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are such ideas feasible?

Japanese and Chinese have nothing in common, yet when the Chinese writing system made it to Japan over 1000 years ago it was the only one they had. Initially, it was used only to write Chinese, but then it was developed into a system suitable to write Japanese via many intermediate steps and multiple parallel paths. Now, centuries later, Japanese has:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - some characters that are identical to (traditional) Chinese ones with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 大 (large) or 中 (centre)&#xD;&#xA; - some characters whose written forms have been simplified from traditional Chinese but with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 国 (state) 売 (to sell)&#xD;&#xA; - two sets of characters that are radically simplified/modified from their traditional forms and used only for their phonetic value (katakana and hiragana)&#xD;&#xA; - some characters whose written forms are as in traditional Chinese but whose meanings have departed. The best example I could find was 豚 which means *pig* in Japanese but *piglet* in Chinese.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; (Of course, some characters’ meanings departed in Chinese while they are still used in their original sense in Japanese like 湯 (*hot water* in Japanese and old Chinese; *soup* in modern Chinese; they shouldn’t be listed in a separate bullet point because they generally fit the first)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - compound words composed of more than one character with a meaning akin to the Chinese one&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - compound words composed of more than one character with a completely different meaning (手紙 which in Japanese means *letter* (the one you send) but in Chinese is toilet paper)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - entirely newly created written compounds, often spelt with hiragana and kanji to better reproduce Japanese grammar&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - new characters created by combining individual parts, e.g. 働 (to work) made from the individual symbols 人 (man, person) and 動 (to move); the former regularly becomes a ‘pole with a steep hat’ in compounds such as 休&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As Japanese and Chinese are linguistically so different (Chinese can have closed syllables, it has tones, the vowel registers differ and more), the Japanese pronunciation of Chinese characters obviously differs substantially from their original at the time of borrowing. In general, most characters can be pronounced in two or more ways depending on their surrounding. These pronunciations are grouped into *kun* (have nothing to do with the Chinese original pronunciation; this is a Japanese word with a similar or identical meaning) and *on* (more or less loosely modelled on the Chinese pronunciation when the character was borrowed which may have happened more than once). However, even *on* pronunciations can be considered a simplification at best; a bastardisation of th original pronunciation may be more accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences notwithstanding, I know one Chinese who claims to be able to get the basic gist of written Japanese and with some crude knowledge of Japanese I was able to grasp the meanings of some things written in Chinese on Taiwan recently.

When I say three words, I mean three *base* words, which new words can be developed from. Again, don't dismiss me immediately. Let me explain my idea, and then please critique it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The three base words would each have particular consonants and one particular vowel, in the structure 1v2v3 (where v represents the vowel, and the numbers represent the four consonants). For a silly example, let's say the three words are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sazar**: Fire (s, z, r; a)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Kitiv**: Lie (k, t, v: i)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Lomon**: Truth (l, m, n; o)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(If I were to actually construct this language, I would *definitely* use different base words, but let's stick with these for the sake of example.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are thirteen distinct combinations of these letters to be derived from these words (1, 2, 3, v, 1v, 2v, v2, v3, 1v2, 2v3, v2v, 1v2v, v2v3), and that's without rearranging the letters at all. If you allow for rearranging letters, there are thirty-one  distinct combinations (if I did my math right). Including the original &quot;word&quot;, it's thirty-two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these combinations templates can result in 96 different roots/suffixes/prefixes/etc. If you somehow made each combination represent some kind of modifier that can be made to a root word, could you construct, if not a language, then at least a grammar system, this way?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if we made v3 represent plurality (-iv=singular, -on=plural, -ar=dual) and v2 represent person (-it=first person, -om=third person, and -az=second person) then that could be the conjugation for the language, giving you:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I**: -itiv&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**You**: -aziv&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**He/She/It**: -omiv&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**We**: -iton (or -itar for special, dual cases)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**You pl.**: -azon (or -azar for special, dual cases)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**They**: -omon (or -omar for special, dual cases)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, -omiv could be extended using v1, which would represent gender (-as=neuter, -ik=female, -ol=male). Using this, the conjugation for he would be the way-too-long-for-conjugation &quot;-omivol&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could make a modifier for roots that determine whether it's a noun, verb, or adjective, and you could also have the three tenses (it's fascinating how much language fits into groups of three) and make cases using combinations of the vowels and consonants, and you would have to stretch some things for prepositions, but maybe instead of having prepositions be words, you could make this an entirely written language and use visuals to convey prepositions (essentially making sentence order influence the physical positions of the objects the words refer to, instead of the grammatical meaning of the words).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would probably need to create a couple (or many) other roots that the modifiers would be added to (or at least start with more flexible words than fire, lie, and truth), but could I at least base the grammar system off of only the three original words and modifiers derived from those three words?"

The obviative is sometimes called the fourth person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The term fourth person is also sometimes used for **the category of indefinite or generic referents**, which work like one in English phrases such as &quot;one should be prepared&quot; or people in people say that..., when the grammar treats them differently from ordinary third-person forms. The so-called &quot;zero person&quot; in Finnish and related languages, in addition to passive voice may serve to leave the subject-referent open. Zero person subjects are sometimes translated as &quot;one,&quot; but the problem with that is that English language constructions involving one, e.g. &quot;One hopes that will not happen,&quot; are rare[citation needed] and could be considered expressive of an overly academic tone to the majority of people, while Finnish sentences like &quot;Ei saa koskettaa&quot; (&quot;Not allowed to touch&quot;) are recognizable to and used by young children in both languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the grammatical persons of a language would be based on how the speakers of that language interact. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would personally collapse singular and plural, and then think about what other possible persons there could be, adding **fourth** and **fifth** person conjugations as is fitting, but you could also remove a person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## No First Person&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, you could have a heavy emphasis on an ego-less society, which would do away with the first-person.

For example, you might have one (or many) declension groups that include words ending in consonant clusters; their feature may be that the ending tacked on always begins with a vowel to ensure a pronounceable syllable. On the other hand, you might decide to group together words ending in Vs, Vz, Vd and Vt (V = vowel sound) and have all their declension patterns be Vt + ending. These strategies reduce the potentially very high number of patterns to a more managable set – and are likely to have happened in natural languages anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, I would like to point out that Finnish and German are each rather close to what you have in mind. While native Finnish words can only /t, s, n, r, l/ or a vowel, loan words from other languages do not necessarily abide by this rule and newer loans have resisted change to fit Finnish phonotactics somewhat. In declensed forms, an /i/ is added between stem and ending to turn it into a fully allowed syllable. In German (subject to terminal devoicing) there aren’t any restrictions on final sounds that I am aware of. Indeed, declension is usually very simple being made up only of a sometimes optional filler-e plus a case-marking consonant so declension is not as complex as found in other languages."

Majority language wins. This happened in China at least twice, it was conquered and ruled by foreign people (Mongolians, Manchu), but the ruling class became sinified. It also happened in medieval France and Spain, they were conquered and ruled be Germanic tribes (Franks and Burgundians for France, Vandals and Goths for Spain), but the majority language of the residents won out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Most prestigious language wins. This happend in antiquity in the Roman empire, and we see it in many post-colonial states in Africa. There are some prerequisites for that such as a working educational system helping that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. [Pidgins][1] and [Creoles][2] emerge, and a Creole wins. This can be watched in Papua New Guinea, where Creole languages like [Police Motu][3] and [Tok Pisin][4] are becoming the *de facto* standard of communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4.

I think what you are suggesting is totally possible and plausible.  The confusion of answers arises from that fact that a &quot;word&quot; can be defined in a couple different ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One reputable definition which allows for your proposed linguistic system is found in the [Collins Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/word_1):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A word is a single unit of language that can be represented in writing or speech. In English, a word has a space on either side of it when it is written.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By that definition, you have designed three possible &quot;units&quot; which can be assigned the title &quot;words&quot; legitimately, and your language system works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, you have other possible definitions, such as that found in [Meriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/word):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A speech sound or series of speech sounds that symbolizes and communicates a meaning usually without being divisible into smaller units capable of independent use&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you opt for that definition (which some people do by default), it's a bit harder to stretch &quot;word&quot; to define what you're talking about.  One of your proposed &quot;words&quot; communicates no inherent meaning, and *is* necessarily divisible into smaller units.  Of course, it's a bit ambiguous, and one could argue that this definition of &quot;word&quot; obfuscates the nature of compound nouns etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, I would answer, **&quot;It depends.&quot;**  If you define a word simply as a unit of speech separated by spaces, you're all set.  Other linguists might argue however that you ought to define the different &quot;words&quot; as different *classes* of words, with the organization of the letters defining words.  And since you're inventing the language, I guess you can set the rules. ☺" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Let me expand a bit below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To answer your question in brief**: *no*, your language does not need a Dative, but *yes*, your language needs a device (or &quot;construction&quot; in Construction Grammar terms) to express the third argument (also called the &quot;indirect object&quot;) of verbs that take on three arguments (subject, object, indirect object).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, whether you have separate devices (constructions, or in your case &quot;cases&quot;, no pun intended) for semantically different indirect objects or not, that is up to you. Since you already have a Benefactive case that could express an indirect object (whether that is semantically a recipient or a beneficiary or else), then you can use that to express an indirect object that is a simple recipient. So, note that **there can be a mismatch between syntactic arguments and semantic arguments** (for example indirect object vs. recipient, benefactor, etc). Moreover, depending on what linguistic framework you assume, things can be slightly different. Here I am adhering to some form of (Radical) Construction Grammar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, since you have a Benefactive case and a Lative case you could use the former in sentences like &quot;I gave the book *to the man*&quot; and &quot;I opened the door *for the woman*&quot; and the Lative case for &quot;I went *to the market*&quot; and &quot;I am throwing a stone *at you*&quot;. But again, that is really up to you, as also hinted at in other answers/comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drafts of the first two chapters of Croft's *Morphosyntax: constructions of the world's languages* expand on this.

He unfortunately spent just as much time attacking Ido as he did supporting Occidental, and kept on proclaiming it to be moribund and ready to collapse for some 20 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's the article in question that he wrote in 1928 on the Ido conference from which he concluded that Ido was on its last legs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://cosmoglotta.pbworks.com/w/page/132587775/Cosmoglotta%20A%20053%20%28oct%201928%29 (Title: Raport del Occidental-Observator Ric.

However, it's also true that the majority of the Occidentalists at that time were once Idists, from Berger to Gär to Ramstedt to Pigal to de Guesnet and all the rest. There was definitely a large influx from Ido to Occidental, and Occidental as far as I can tell was the most active auxiliary language after Esperanto by the late 30s and into the 1940s. Matejka and Berger had a lot of back-and-forth in the 1920s to early 1930s until Matejka decided to move over to Occidental, which he stayed with until his death in the late 1990s. He's probably the most prominent example of a major Idist who went full in on Occidental. But Berger hadn't taken into account the other source for new Idists, namely new users who weren't satisfied with Esperanto but still liked the overall concept (i.e. the people that thought that Zamenhof *almost* got it right).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyhow, I removed that sentence from Wikipedia last year when going through the Cosmoglotta archives because it certainly isn't backed up by anything besides Berger's wishes."

Stress isn't normally marked even in vowelized Hebrew (apart from liturgy or texts for learners), and it's entirely unnecessary in Toki Pona, since there is no phonemic stress.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of this is that it follows ordinary conventions and is most easily intelligible to someone reading in Hebrew. The disadvantage is that implementing this kind of orthography is far from algorithmic and includes unnecessary information in the spelling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Style 2 - minimalistic Hebrew orthography&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since Toki Pona is a minimalistic language, I think that a different transliteration convention would better suit it, to avoid redundancy in writing it. There is precedent for a more minimalistic transcription in the convention used for transliterating, e.g., Akkadian into Hebrew. Modifying it to suit Toki Pona's vowels, we get something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    a אָ  &#xD;&#xA;    e אֵ  &#xD;&#xA;    i אִ  &#xD;&#xA;    o אֹ  &#xD;&#xA;    u אֻ&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Style 3 - Yiddish orthography&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third option, if you want to minimize use of diacritics, is to follow Yiddish spelling conventions. The only required diacritic is to distinguish between the two forms of א. The Yiddish convention of using וו instead of ו as a consonant can be safely ignored in Toki Pona. And actually, since there are [no o/u minimal pairs in Toki Pona](http://www.tokipona.net/tp/MinimalPairs.aspx), you could get rid of all diacritics if you instead choose to use ו for both vowels, at the price of losing some information (style 4).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    a אַ or א&#xD;&#xA;    e ע or ע&#xD;&#xA;    i אי&#xD;&#xA;    o אָ or ו&#xD;&#xA;    u ו&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Sample differences&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Roman x Hebrew x Minimal x Yiddish x 4-vowel&#xD;&#xA;    a     x אָ      x אָ       x אַ       x א&#xD;&#xA;    akesi x אָקֵסִי   x אָקֵסִ    x אַקעסי   x אקעסי&#xD;&#xA;    anpa  x אָנְפָה   x אָנפָ    x אַנפאַ    x אנפא&#xD;&#xA;    mije  x מִייֵה   x ֵמִי     x מייע    x מייע&#xD;&#xA;    mute  x מוּטֵה   x ֵמֻט     x מוטע    x מוטע&#xD;&#xA;    seli  x סֵלִי    x ִסֵל     x סעלי    x סעלי&#xD;&#xA;    toki  x טוֹקִי   x טֹקִ     x טאָקי    x טוקי&#xD;&#xA;    wawa  x וָאוָה   x וָוָ     x ואַואַ    x ואוא" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In a grammar such as this, a sentence like &quot;Every woman sees a man&quot; is represented as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ∀x(woman′(x) → (∃y(man′(y) ∧ sees′(x,y)))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, in order to derive this compositionally (i.e., from the meaning of each word in the sentence combined together), the meanings of each word is as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;woman&quot; = λx.woman′(x)&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;man&quot; = λx.man′(x)&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;sees&quot; = λy.λx.sees′(x,y)&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;a&quot; = λP.λQ.∃x((P(x)∧Q(x)))&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;every&quot; = λP.λQ.∀x((P(x)∧Q(x)))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully you can already see a problem here -- where do we actually get the meanings of woman′ and man′ and sees′ from? In this type of grammar, any noun like &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;man&quot; is a function mapping entities to boolean values -- in other words, &quot;woman&quot; is a list of every entity that exists in the world and either a 1 or a 0 depending whether that entity is a woman. A transitive verb like &quot;sees&quot; is a function that maps entities to entities to boolean values based on whether the first entity sees the second entity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This, as you can imagine, isn't a super satisfying way to define a word -- defining &quot;woman&quot; as the set of all women is kinda circular, at best -- but semanticists generally acknowledge that the meaning of individual lexical items just cannot be formalized like this and leave that for lexical semanticists to figure out (and they, to my knowledge, generally do not try to formalize the meanings of individual words like this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, this has all been sort of a tangent from your original question, but in short: mathematics and the notation we use for it are not language in and of themselves, but there are formal/mathematical ways of representing human language. These formalisms can capture a lot about the relationships between words in a language, but they struggle to capture the actual meaning of a particular word, and thus in that way still ultimately fall short of the underlying expressive power of human language unless augmented with some way of truly capturing a content word's meaning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most conlangs aim to emulate the expressive capabilities of human language and, as such, we generally would not consider formal languages like programming languages or lambda calculus conlangs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/1034/52&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_grammar" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

When I tried making noun declensions I generally end up making something that turns into agglutinitive suffixes... E.g. if we have a masculine noun ending in -o, I simply use consonants after the -o to express cases, then change the -o to -a for plural and repeat.

Study those systems to some detail and than decide what you want to take from them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also look at derivative morphology: There are common verbal prefixes among Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, and Germanic (at least), and there are common methods to form compound nouns.

Under your original system they'd be:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - minano / minanog / minanot / minanom / minanol&#xD;&#xA; - minano / minanag / minanat / minanam / minanal&#xD;&#xA; - nukugo / nukugog / nukugot / nukugom / nukugol&#xD;&#xA; - nukuga / nukugag / nukugat / nukugam / nukugal&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After the first sound change: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - minano / minanog / minanot / minanum / minanol&#xD;&#xA; - minana / minanag / minanit / minanam / minanal&#xD;&#xA; - nukugo / nukugog / nukugot / nukugum / nukugol&#xD;&#xA; - nukuga / nukugag / nukugit / nukugum / nukugal&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Okay, no problem, still sort of regular, no difference between the two nouns, the only change has been to the affix. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And after the second:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - minano / minanok / minanot / minanum / minanol&#xD;&#xA; - minana / minanag / minanit / minanam / minanal&#xD;&#xA; - nukuko / nukukok / nukukot / nukukum / nukukol&#xD;&#xA; - nukuka / nukukag / nukugit / nukukum / nukukal&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now add a third sound change: If you an unvoiced consonant between two identical vowels, that consonant is dropped and the vowels become one lengthened one&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - minano / minanok / minanot / minanum / minanol&#xD;&#xA; - minana / minanag / minanit / minanam / minanal&#xD;&#xA; - nuuko / nuukok / nuukot / nuuum / nuukol&#xD;&#xA; - nuuka / nuukag / nuugit / nuuam / nuukal&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Okay, now we have a situation where you've got *nuuum*. Let's suppose the phonotactics of your language don't allow vowels that long or the same vowel repeated that often, and if that situation ever arises, that third vowel is replaced by a glottal stop followed by a schwa (that I'll write as *'e*).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - minano / minanok / minanot / minanum / minanol&#xD;&#xA; - minana / minanag / minanit / minanam / minanal&#xD;&#xA; - nuuko / nuukok / nuukot / nuu’em / nuukol&#xD;&#xA; - nuuka / nuukag / nuugit / nuuam / nuukal&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Final sound change: if a word final *-t* or *-l* is preceded by *-ku-* or *-ko-*, the vowel is dropped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So here's the final outcome of the two words:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - minano / minanok / minanot / minanum / minanol&#xD;&#xA; - minana / minanag / minanit / minanam / minanal&#xD;&#xA; - nuuko / nuukok / nuukt / nuu’em / nuukl&#xD;&#xA; - nuuka / nuukag / nuugit / nuuam / nuukal&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first has remained pretty regular, the second not so much."

The Sumerians wrote in cuneiform. This later got foisted on the Akkadians, the Hittites, the Iranians, etc. The Romans wrote with an alphabet, and that got foisted on just about the whole world, even those prestigious languages that have long had their own systems. Mostly as a matter of convenience to online existence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a language inventor, you get to play with these forces and circumstances. And I at least advocate out several forms of writing for a language to see which you think is the better fit. Especially if you happen to be, as a matter of philosophy, a language ***inventor***.  If you happen to be a language ***discoverer***, then you might come to the realisation that such-and-such a language uses a particular system, and you'll just live with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trying out several systems at once, perhaps using a well known example text, will give you a good feel for how it meshes with the language structure. This exercise will also teach you how well (or how poorly) you understand either that kind of writing system or your own language's make-up! If you think a fixed syllable structure might benefit from a syllabary, then try it out! But if you discover that your &quot;fixed syllable structure&quot; is full of complications, exceptions, alterations, and so forth, you might find that a syllabary becomes unwieldy. That's not necessarily a bad thing --- scribes and writers have long had to deal with terribly complex writing systems (Egyptian! Sumerian! Chinese!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Creating a few &quot;temporary&quot; writing systems for use with any later invented language project could also be useful. Doing this, you won't have to invent a whole new syllabary, a whole new alphabet for each future language project. The actual symbols won't necessarily be the symbols that get used for any language; they're just a tool to help you evaluate compatibility.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for an evaluation tool, first I'd do some research into how many symbols various natural language systems have. In English, which uses an alphabet, we basically have 26 symbols. Abjads only notate consonants. So if English used an abjad, that would be 19 to 21 symbols (depending on how you count w &amp; y). At the other end is Chinese, whose logogrammes number over a hundred thousand (according to WP's citation of a modern Chinese dictionary); but you'd only need about 2000 to read a newspaper. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This will you give a rough idea of how much work is going to go into devising characters for the invented language vs how much work is going to go into inventing the language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, you'll want to consider how different writing systems work vs how your language works. No writing system perfectly captures the sounds of any language, except for the IPA. Everything else is a compromise. A language that is heavy on nuanced content words, a logography might be too unwieldy. A language with few lexical items might be very comfortable with logogrammes. A language with lots of vowels may not get along with anything but an alphabet: is PN abjad spelling for pan, pawn, pain, pean, pen, pin, pine, pane, pone, pon, or pun?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You'll also want to consider aesthetic qualities of the writing system. If you find cuneiform logogrammes are just the bees knees, then aesthesis might outweigh the difficulties of having to make hundreds of symbols. If calligraphy is more your style, then an alphabet or an abjad might be better choices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, don't neglect combination systems! If you really like the aesthetics of logograpmmes, but don't want to bother with hundreds or thousands, consider a hybrid system where certain symbols have come to take on syllabic or alphabetic function, while certain words or classes of words continue to be written using full logogrammes."

Alphabets are a pretty reasonable writing system for most spoken languages. I think there's a good reason why the majority of languages with standard written forms use some sort of alphabet. That said, they seem to take a long time to develop, so alphabets are unlikely for concultures that recently discovered writing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Abjads&#xD;&#xA;======&#xD;&#xA;Examples: Arabic, Hebrew, Tifinagh. Abjads are good for languages with few vowels and very few minimal pairs distinguished by vowels. It's especially good in languages with triconsonental roots or other forms that undergo dramatic vowel shift as part of regular grammatical processes to improve coherence across grammatical forms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Abugidas&#xD;&#xA;========&#xD;&#xA;Examples: Devanagari, Ge'ez (Ethiopic), Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics. Abugdias are pretty good for languages with relatively simple syllable structure (ideally not more complex than (C)CV(C)). Based on the real world, it seems that they're best suited for languages with a high number of tones or phonations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Syllabaries&#xD;&#xA;===========&#xD;&#xA;Examples: Hiragana*, Vai, Cherokee. Syllabaries are really only appropriate in languages with relatively simple phonology, ideally not more than (C)V (or adopt a pseudo-syllabary like the kana with separate symbols for coda consonants). Otherwise the number of characters grows exponentially, or will not do a very good job representing all segments of the language, though this is not necessarily a dealbreaker (cf. Cherokee).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;\* Hiragana is not a true Syllabary because each kana actually represents a mora, not a syllable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Logographies&#xD;&#xA;============&#xD;&#xA;Examples: Chinese, Cuneiform, Mayan. Logographs are best suited to isolating and analytic languages. The earliest writing systems seem to be logographies though, so cultures that only recently discovered writing are most likely to have logographies." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

English mostly do not create words from the root, rather it kind of borrows from other languages. Languages like Chinese and Tamil do not borrow words, it creates new words from the existing words. So, if a conlang you are going to create is like English, it might need more words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, where and how this conlang is going to be used plays an major role too. For example, take [Dovah language][1], a conlang. This language does not need words related to technology and science as this language is not going to be used in modern timeline, but an ancient timeline. So if the conlang is going to be made for a specific purpose, it is not necessary to add unrelated words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, number of words could be even 340 words(*Taki Taki (also called Sranan), 340 words.

Chinese is a highly analytic language and it uses ideograms. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But it has to be noted that writing systems also depend on the languages and cultures that are nearby, but languages like Japanese still created its own script (Hiragana and Katakana, which are syllabaries) so that it would be easy to write.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coming back to the question, choosing the right writing system is necessary as it is the first thing people are going to study in a language. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If you choose ideogram like Chinese, it would be easy if the conlang&#xD;&#xA;   is analytical.

Alphabets too make a fine choice, but trust me,&#xD;&#xA;   representing agglutinating parts in alphabets is not efficient. Korean might be an exception.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; - Alphabets are universal, and could be used for any type of language.&#xD;&#xA;   But if you want to increase the complexity of the language and need&#xD;&#xA;   more elegant and unique language, it might not be great to choose&#xD;&#xA;   alphabets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thank you for reading."

They aren't really strict implications so much as Stuff You Might Consider Thinking About™. I think the effects of choosing secundative alignment are pretty local overall and won't have cascading effects on your grammar. In my opinion, the thorniest issue here is dealing with valence-changing operations on verbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - What do secundative languages tend to look like in the real world?&#xD;&#xA; - How does secundative alignment manifest itself in morphology or syntax?&#xD;&#xA; - Valence-changing operations&#xD;&#xA; - Relative Clauses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Real World Secundative Languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want your language to be naturalistic, I suggest taking a look at WALS to see what kinds of combinations of features are typologically uncommon. If you are not trying to make a naturalistic language, knowing what natural languages tend to do is a good way to spend your &quot;weirdness budget&quot; wisely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This map][1] marks the strategy used for the verb `to give`. This analysis could be misleading because it's possible for the verb `give` to use a different strategy from other verbs, but I think this feature is the best fit for what you're after of the available WALS features.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at the map, my assessment of the _broad_ areal trends is that Eurasia is dominated by the indirect object construction. The secondary object construction seems to be common in North America and in New Guinea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The WALS Chapter for this feature][2] provides some examples of the different types of constructions as well as a note about what other features commonly co-occur with secondary object marking, excerpt below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...head-marking languages with verb indexing of two core arguments tend&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to show the secondary-object pattern...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does secundative alignment manifest itself?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, there are three ways your language can manifest secundative alignment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - word order&#xD;&#xA; - presence of dedicated adpositions&#xD;&#xA; - case markers&#xD;&#xA; - verbal agreement&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think most of the real world secundative languages are secundative because the recipient in the verb `to give` or other similar verbs gets indexed in the verb the same way that a prototypical direct object would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This can occur in a language with no case marking. So, I give you the book might be something like&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    book.sg  give.1sg-subj.2sg-obj&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this example, book bears no case marking but is clearly the theme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The case marking strategy is covered in your example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For word order, we can take an example from English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I give you the book&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`you` is the recipient, but occupies the position directly after the verb. In English you have a choice between using a preposition like `to` or `for` instead. If no such option existed, this would be a pristine example of syntactic secundativeness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the language can be _partially secundative_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, the following is possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    you.sg.DAT book.sg.ACC give.1sg-subj.2sg-obj&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this example, the two non-agent arguments `book` and `give` receive indirect-object-style case marking, but the verb shows secundative alignment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Valence changing operations&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to think about how the _passive voice_, if it exists, should behave.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose we have a language with secundative alignment in its cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.NOM you.OBJ book.INST give.PST&#xD;&#xA;    I gave you a book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you were to passivize the verb, which argument would be promoted to the agent? Would (101), (102), or neither be acceptable?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    (101) you.NOM  give.PSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;    (102) book.NOM give.PSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you have an _anti-applicative_ voice that deletes the recipient and promotes the theme to primary object? As far as I know, _anti-applicative_ voices do not exist in the real world, but [applicative voice][3] does exist. It's possible to allow this promotion without an explicit voice for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.NOM book.OBJ give.ANTIAPP.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This situation gets murkier if the language is both ergative and secundative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ERG you.ABS book.INST give.PST&#xD;&#xA;    I gave the book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the antipassive voice would delete the absolutive argument and promote the ergative argument.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ABS book.INST give.ANTIPSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;    I gave the book (to someone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some ergative languages mark instruments and agents the same way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ERG book.ERG you.ABS give.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the antipassive voice could potentially target either argument.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ABS give.ANTIPSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    book.ABS give.ANTIPSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Relative clauses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Deciding how relative clauses in secundative languages should work might present some subtle issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Languages frequently have a limit on what kinds of arguments can be targeted by relative clauses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may want to choose to make only the agent and the primary object extractable, but not secondary objects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://wals.info/combinations/105A?v2=dff0#3/10.14/148.89&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://wals.info/chapter/105&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_voice" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I was wondering if there was a structured dictionary available for it, or whether people have attempted to create one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me explain what I mean by &quot;structured dictionary&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are only 120-odd words in toki pona. The word _jan_ refers to a person. Compounds are used to be more specific, ie _jan pona_ is &quot;friend&quot;, _jan utala_ is &quot;fighter&quot;, _jan alasa_ is &quot;hunter&quot;, etc. This is reminiscent of expressing the meaning of nouns through semantic primitives, a bit like Wilks (1975). So the set of words described by _jan_ would be {&quot;person&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;hunter&quot;, ...}. There are subsets which are more specific, so _jan utala_ is {&quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;soldier&quot;, &quot;mercenary&quot;, ...}. _jan utala pi ma_ would be {&quot;soldier&quot;, &quot;private&quot;, &quot;general&quot;, ...}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can envisage it as a tree structure, where the leaves are the word meanings, and the roots (as there would be multiple trees: one for each 'top' primitive) encompasses all of them. As you wander down the tree, the path is an ever longer chain of toki pona words, and the set of meanings covered by those words becomes smaller and smaller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another example would be _ilo_, &quot;tool&quot;. _ilo toki_ is a tool for communication: {&quot;telephone&quot;, &quot;telegraph&quot;, &quot;vhf radio&quot;, &quot;loud hailer&quot;, ...}; _ilo toki uta suli_ (tool talk mouth big) could be a loud hailer. Another sub-tree would capture wireless communication devices, perhaps _ilo toki pi kon_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know this somewhat goes against the toki pona philosophy of being a simple and small language, but it seems to me to more or less accidentally provide a useful set of semantic primitives that can be used to describe word meanings in general. So before I embark on creating such a structure, has anyone already attempted something similar? Surely there must be dictionaries of mulit-word toki pona expressions? I haven't been able to find a good one yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wilks, Y (1975) _An Intelligent Analyzer and Understander of English_, Communications of the ACM 18(5):264-274&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Thus, I'd argue that it is &quot;naturalistic&quot; to insert morphology into your protolanguage. After all, it's already there! Else, your daughter languages most likely wouldn't have the concept at all.

Just because English got rid of almost all of its endings doesn't mean we did away with morphology! We just tucked it away somewhere else, in this case, word order. This is why Latin can put the agent or the patient before the verb, but English, except in unusual circumstances, can not.

Over time, as has happened in real languages, this was simplified to a simpler singular/plural system except in personal pronouns, which retained the original distinctions. In other words, the language would distinguish only between &quot;woman&quot; (one woman) and &quot;women&quot; (more than one woman), but when you used a pronoun, you'd have &quot;she&quot; (one woman), &quot;she2&quot; (two women&quot;), &quot;she+&quot; (a few women), and &quot;she++&quot; (many women).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your conversations would those look like the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;That woman came out of the store. She is carrying a bag.&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Those women came out of the store. She2 are carrying bags.&quot; (Two women came out)&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Those women came out of the store.

She++ are carrying bags.&quot; (Many women came out)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A similar situation situation would occur with all personal pronouns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the question: while this sort of thing is obviously possible, since I just described it, is this a feature which has been documented in a natural language? I'm not just restricting it the way I've done, but the general situation where the grammar of the language has simplified down the grammatical number, perhaps even to not having a singular/plural distinction at all, except for retaining a more elaborate grammatical number system in one single common grammatical element."

It's tough to know exactly what this would look like without knowing the technology level of your world, but since you want a timeframe, let's say 50 years.

So, the heavenly stems form a small closed system with additional meaning besides designated a day of the week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tying the symbols-as-days-of-week to a religion, current or historical, is probably a good way to make the system plausible in your conworld.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you specifically mentioned *not* wanting to name days after numbers, but some very widely spoken languages do exactly this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think you can make the 12-day week in two halves thing make sense by having a duodecimal number system with six as a sub-base. In a system like this, some or all the numbers in the 7 to 12 range would be derived from the words for 1 to 6. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Mandarin Chinese, the days of the week are simply numbered, with Sunday being an exception to the pattern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [星期一 (week 1)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%98%9F%E6%9C%9F%E4%B8%80#Chinese) means Monday.&#xD;&#xA;- [星期二 (week 2)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%98%9F%E6%9C%9F%E4%BA%8C#Chinese) means Tuesday.&#xD;&#xA;- [星期日 (week sun)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%98%9F%E6%9C%9F%E6%97%A5#Chinese) or [星期天 (week sky)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%98%9F%E6%9C%9F%E5%A4%A9#Chinese) means Sunday.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, some number systems have a sub-base.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaktovik_Inupiaq_numerals#Sub-base_5) is a numeral system developed for an Inuit language with a vigesimal number system by speakers of the language.

(In contrast, for example, Old English arose from the Anglo-Saxon invasion of a linguistically Celtic and Latin speaking island, and Middle English arose as the main modification in the wake of England's conquest by a French speaking Normal elite and England was extremely involved in contacting other civilizations globally as part of its diplomatic, trade and cultural interactions with Europe and as a result of its global empire.) &#xA;&#xA;Iceland was an uninhabited island (hence not subject to any substrate influences unlike many other colonists) settled in the historic era by colonists who spoke a single shared language fairly close to &quot;Old Norse&quot; (the proto-language of the Germanic languages), who had a total population similar to that of a generation ship. &#xA;&#xA;Somewhat more subtly, Iceland's colonists were looking for economic opportunities, rather than constituting a cultural minority fleeing persecution in their homeland the way, for example, that the Puritan colonists of New England were, so they were not motivated at the outset to intentionally set out to put linguistic and cultural distance between themselves and the speakers of their original mother tongue the way that early Americans deliberately attempted to distinguish themselves linguistically from England to assert a distinct cultural identity. The Iceland situation of a group of people not committed ideologically to putting cultural distance between themselves and their ancestor population would likely also be true of the people on a generation ship.&#xA;&#xA;The descendants of the original colonists of Iceland remained in constant communication with each other ever after, just as generation ship residents would, although this did break up from a single community into about a dozen or so chiefdoms that were substantially autonomous from each other and had distinct identities although they did retain a very thin form of island-wide weak government. So, tribal divisions, per se, do not distinguish a generation ship from Iceland. &#xA;&#xA;And, Iceland received almost no significant waves of migration prior to the recent past, so it has never had a large community of outside language learners to influence its linguistic development (just as would be the case in a generation ship).&#xA;&#xA;While Iceland wasn't as isolated from other people as generation ship would be, for a period of time roughly equal to the length of a generation ship journey prior to the introduction of telecommunications, Iceland was very isolated from the rest of the world, and the vast majority of what little contact it did have with the rest of the world from visiting ships was with people who spoke the closest linguistic relative of their language in the world. So, it did not have any languages from which to borrow words, and it was not subject to any areal effects from neighboring languages in a significant way (apart from Danish rule whose effect is noted below).&#xA;&#xA;Icelandic is by far the most linguistically static of the Germanic languages, with the only significant change being a change in pronunciation that arose during a several century period of Danish rule, a country that speaks a closely related by different language derived from Old Norse. A generation ship would not experience this outside influence and would not need to develop a new written language as Iceland did. &#xA;&#xA;As Wikipedia explains (at the link above):&#xA;&#xA;&gt; The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD.&#xA;&gt; Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved&#xA;&gt; orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in Iceland&#xA;&gt; from the 12th century onward, are the Icelandic Sagas. They comprise&#xA;&gt; the historical works and the eddaic poems.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; The language of the sagas is Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old&#xA;&gt; Norse. The Dano-Norwegian, then later Danish rule of Iceland from 1536&#xA;&gt; to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic (in contrary&#xA;&gt; to the Norwegian language), which remained in daily use among the&#xA;&gt; general population. Though more archaic than the other living Germanic&#xA;&gt; languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th&#xA;&gt; to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, á, æ, au,&#xA;&gt; and y/ý).&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; The modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard&#xA;&gt; established in the 19th century, primarily by the Danish linguist&#xA;&gt; Rasmus Rask. It is based strongly on an orthography laid out in the&#xA;&gt; early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as The First&#xA;&gt; Grammatical Treatise by an anonymous author, who has later been&#xA;&gt; referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard&#xA;&gt; was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit&#xA;&gt; concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of k rather&#xA;&gt; than c. Various archaic features, as the letter ð, had not been used&#xA;&gt; much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in&#xA;&gt; practice. Later 20th-century changes include the use of é instead of&#xA;&gt; je and the removal of z from the Icelandic alphabet in 1973.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; **Apart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not&#xA;&gt; changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts&#xA;&gt; were written on vellum. Modern speakers can understand the&#xA;&gt; original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years&#xA;&gt; ago.** The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and&#xA;&gt; footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of&#xA;&gt; Shakespeare). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand&#xA;&gt; the original manuscripts.&#xA;&#xA;Also, usually new vocabulary is developed in response to new topics of conversation. Since the environment would change less and there would be fewer new things on a generation ship than in Iceland over the same time period (in part, due to a generation ship's lack of trade with the outside world that Iceland had) one would expect there to be less innovation in vocabulary on a generation ship than there was in Iceland. Still, as noted by @Hyperneutrino one might expect words that residents of a generation ship have no reason to use to be lost early on from popular speech (although presumably written sources would still preserve the old words for those so inclined, as a generation ship's residents would not be illiterate and written languages stabilize spelling and prevent old words from dying completely), and there would be a few new words developed over time.&#xA;&#xA;Another clue with which I have first hand experience, which corroborates the example of Iceland, is the development of motherland languages in immigrant communities. For example, the dialect of Korean spoken in Korean immigrant communities in the U.S. that formed shortly after the Korean War is much more similar to the dialect spoken at the time of migration than the dialect of Korean currently spoken in South Korea, notwithstanding the fact that there have been many visits to South Korea and there has been access to modern Korean television and music in that time period in the U.S. Small, relatively isolated communities are simply much less linguistically innovative than large communities that are strongly connected to neighboring communities that speak different languages.&#xA;&#xA;In summary then, it is likely that the language of a generation ship would be extremely static over a period of approximately 1,000 years, because generally speaking it would be in conditions very similar to those of Iceland which historically has had an extremely static language over a similar time period under similar conditions. And, several of the factors that are know to have led to the modest changes between Old Icelandic and Modern Iceland over that time period would be absent on a generation ship.&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I talked there about the Greek influence (which is slight, from the information we have); the Hittite roots are of course much stronger. An example passage given by the creator shows Article 1 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), in Hittite and Eressilian:&#xA;&gt; ### Hittite&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; Hūmant+es antuhsa+es arawa+iya+ya annual+iya kraht(Persian)+a hoquq(Persian/Arabic) anda asanzi hassant+ke.

For instance, the Hittite &quot;antuhsa es&quot; appears similar to the Eressilian &quot;ãndushesh&quot; - both meaning, I believe, &quot;man&quot; or &quot;human&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;## [Goa'uld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa%27uld#Language) (Egyptian) (sort of)&#xA;&#xA;This is the &quot;language&quot; spoken by the Goa'uld race in [*Stargate*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate). It's ostensibly based in ancient Egyptian, drawing from the language and hieroglyphs - appropriate, given that the Goa'uld supposedly ruled Earth as gods, sometimes appearing as the gods of the ancient Egyptians. I keep seeing references to a writing variation called Nakht, which I can't find much information on.&#xA;&#xA;Some (though not much) of the writing uses the [Meroitic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_alphabet). To my (untrained) eye, there don't appear to be a huge amount of similarities (see [Meroitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Meroitic.png) and [Goa'uld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Goa%27uld_alphabet.GIF)), but some crossovers show through pretty easily, such as &quot;l&quot;s and &quot;n&quot;s. Those are probably the main Meroitic contributions.&#xA;&#xA;All that said . . . [Goa'uld vocabulary is basically made up](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/41162/41082), and so it's not really a conlang. No attempts were made to keep much linguistic continuity, and so it's not a constructed language as such. There are probably *some* similarities to ancient Egyptian, but likely not many. I include it here only because its use of some ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs is notable; it appears that an alphabet for the language was indeed constructed.&#xA;&#xA;## [Irǧeret](https://forum.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?t=43643) (Egyptian and Akkadian, with Ugaritic, Arabic and Hebrew influences)&#xA;&#xA;This one seems decently documented by its author. The vocabulary and phonology are derived from Egyptian, although there isn't much vocabulary listed. The organization of nouns - in number and gender - resembles Akkadian. It also contains the Akkadian declensions, with the addition of the dative. In short, the grammar and morphology appears Akkadian, while the vocabulary should be Egyptian. It's an interesting blend.&#xA;&#xA;## A note on [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)&#xA;&#xA;A couple of languages have been derived from Proto-Indo-European, the reconstructed common ancestor of Indo-European languages. It's only known indirectly. Therefore, many (though not all) conlangs that are based on it also use words from more recent Indo-European languages. Proto-Indo-European is certainly antique; whether it's &quot;lesser-known&quot; is perhaps another question entirely. That said, it's not a terribly common template, and so I'm listing some Proto-Indo-European languages here for the sake of interest.&#xA;&#xA; - **[Sambahsa](http://sambahsa.pbworks.com/w/page/10183084/FrontPage%7CThe):**  [Sambahsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambahsa), an [international auxiliary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language), appears to be heavily influenced by Proto-Indo-European, primarily through vocabulary. It modifies words from languages ranging from India to Spain, attempting to go back to the languages' common roots.&#xA; - **[Atlantean](https://web.archive.org/web/20140323053118/http://www.freewebs.com/keran_shadlag/) (Proto-Indo-European):** Like Sambahsa, [Atlantean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantean_language) is Proto-Indo-European in origin, especially when it comes to vocabulary (grammatically, it is quite different). Notably, it was created by Marc Okrand, the man behind Klingon. According to the linked website, Okrand&#xA;   &gt; took Proto-Indo-European roots and then compared them with language families at various points in time from around the world.  Where similarities between words existed, he altered the root or its semantic value to reflect that similarity.  By the combination of the PIE roots and by the adoption of new roots from these world languages, he created a vocabulary.&#xA;&#xA;Given that these languages borrow vocabulary from many descendants of Proto-Indo-European, you could argue that they're not directly based in it. However, the intentional linguistic diversity within the family - and the attempts to base words on common similarities that are attributable to Proto-Indo-European - do seem to make these conlangs its descendants."

(continuous)&#xA;&#xA;.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; I will have eaten sushi. (perfect)&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; I will be eating sushi. (continuous)&#xA;&#xA;I don't know if someone has a complete list of possible aspects, but here are some possibilities:&#xA;&#xA; 1. The action was/is/will be finished (perfect)&#xA; 2. The action is/was/will be ongoing (continuous)&#xA; 3. The action is/was/will be continually performed (habitual)&#xA; 4. The action is/was/will be going to start (inceptive)&#xA; 5. The action is/was/will be intermitently performed (iterative)&#xA;&#xA;That's the difference. Now comes the confusion - because that is what languages do, they confuse tense and aspect, in incoherent and incomplete systems that fail to either integrate or clearly separate those features.&#xA;&#xA;One first source of confusion is that many languages operate not only with the simple distinction between tenses as outlined above - past, present, future - but also with dependent and independent tenses. For instance, I may say&#xA;&#xA;&gt; I used to eat sushi when Susan introduced me to Javanese food.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; I am eating sushi while the president threats nuclear war against North Korea.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; I will be eating sushi when they bring the wine.&#xA;&#xA;in which one action is past, present or future regarding the time of the speech (Susan introduced me to Javanese food in the past, the president is threatening nuclear war in the present, they will bring wine in the future) while the other (me eating sushi) happens in the present - not the present regarding the time of speech, however, but the present regarding the other action.&#xA;&#xA;And while this may be a source of confusion by itself, it expands to a further level of confusion because the interaction between dependent and independent action often has implications on the aspectuality of each of them. For instance, I say&#xA;&#xA;&gt; I eat sushi. - or&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; I am eating sushi.&#xA;&#xA;it is understood that these are different aspects: in the first sentence, I am saying that I do habitually eat sushi, not that I have a dish of sushi in front of me. In the second sentence, however, I am saying that I am actually eating sushi in the moment I am talking, so the sentences are not synonim to each other.&#xA;&#xA;But if I say&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I eat sushi. - or&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I am eating sushi.&#xA;&#xA;the phrase &quot;eat sushi&quot; loses its habitual aspect, and turn into continuous, and the sentences are effectively synonimous.&#xA;&#xA;The there is the confusion that Sparksbet remarks, between &quot;tense&quot; as a grammatical form, and &quot;tense&quot; as a reference to actual time. As she says, &quot;tenses&quot; as grammatical forms are used to denote a mix of tense references and aspectual references.&#xA;&#xA;Furthermore, while the tense and aspectual references can be several, their grammaticalization, or lack thereof, is much more constrained. For instance, neither English, nor any other Western European language that I know has verb inflections for iterative or inceptive aspects. They instead use either syntactical devices, or morphological derivation - and those often vary weirdly from lexical item to lexical item. Let's take for instance Portuguese:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; *Eu como sushi* (habitual)&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; *Estou comendo sushi* (continuous)&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; *Estou beliscando uns sushis* (iterative) (where a different verb is used to make the aspectual reference)&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; *Eu bebo uísque* (habitual)&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; *Estou bebendo uísque* (continuous)&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; *Estou bebericando uísque* (iterative) (where a morphological derivation of &quot;beber&quot; is used to make the aspectual reference)&#xA;&#xA;So, probably no natural language has a coherent tense-aspect system; the fact that some tenses seem to imply some aspects when put in relation to others probably means that, for reasons of economy, grammatical &quot;tenses&quot; will be used irregularly, given internal or even external context.&#xA;&#xA;Could it be possible to build a conlang with a complete and coherent tense-aspect system? Perhaps, but I would say such coherence and completeness are only going to survive as long as the language is not effectively used by a human population." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In an interview available on [Unidentified Sound Object][3], he details how the language was devised. The director, James Cameron, had created about 30 words many of which he needed as place names. These helped Frommer understand what kind of sounds Cameron had in mind. They discussed what the language would need to be and sound like in general and then Frommer was on his own. Most notably, the only input from the director was a set of isolated words and confirmation that the primary way to differentiate between them should be stress.&#xA;&#xA;Frommer decided that he wanted to employ all sorts of features of various human languages in a unique combination. Thus:&#xA;&#xA; - verbs are inflected by infixes, not the more common prefix or suffix models (suffix inflection is a feature of [Standard Average European][6])&#xA; - the case system is [tripartite][4], a feature which exists but is rarely found in natural languages; SAE would be nominative–accusative&#xA; - the language features [ejective consonantes][5]. Again, these are found in about 20 % of the world’s languages but only the Caucasian languages feature them in Europe&#xA;&#xA;All in all, it seems like any features present in Na’vi that are also present in European languages would be a conscious design choice to not make it too non-European.&#xA;&#xA;Furthermore, the [interview][3] also briefly mentions Klingon:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; USO: Is there a “gold standard” for constructed language that served as an inspiration to you?&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; Frommer: In terms of “alien” languages, that would have to be Klingon, the language developed by linguist Marc Okrand for the **Star Trek** series. It’s a very impressive piece of work—a rough-sounding language with a complex and difficult phonology and grammar that now has a devoted base of followers. There are Klingon clubs all over the world where people meet to speak the language, and there’s even a translation of Hamlet into Klingon!

I am by no means an expert, but this is directly from the mouth of Laáadan's creator.  The following quote contains pertinent excerpts of the article, parts of which I have put in bold:&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Another goal I had for Láadan was that **it should be as easy as possible to figure out what a particular word or morpheme means just by looking at it**...I wanted the language to work like a Tinkertoy® set works, so that people could take the pieces and fit them together easily to make larger forms. For example: the Láadan word for “bee” is “zhomid”; that word is made from “zho” — the Láadan word for “sound,” and “mid” — the Láadan word for “creature.” **The meaning is transparent from the word’s parts.**&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;**First, however, I had to construct the most basic elements of the language — the words/ morphemes that are called “roots” and can’t be taken apart into smaller meaningful pieces**. When linguists begin working with a language for which no grammar or dictionary is available, they ordinarily start with a set of roughly 100 very basic words made up of items like “eat” and “sleep” and “food.” I followed that practice, and began by constructing a core vocabulary of those basic words; when I had those done I began adding additional roots that I felt were needed. **Sometimes I can explain to some extent how I chose a particular shape for one of those words; much of the time I can’t.**&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;For example… I can explain that I chose “oódóo” for “bridge” because when pronounced its tune makes the shape of a humpback bridge. I can explain that I chose “rul” for “cat” because the purring of a cat sounds to me like “rulrulrulrul…” But the choice of “ana” for “food” and “ina” for “sleep” was arbitrary; **I have no explanation for those choices other than that I tried to give them a shape that could easily be combined with other morphemes.** For any constructed language that isn’t based on some existing language, the hardest part will always be putting together the inventory of roots.&#xA;&#xA;An [update to the Láadan dictionary](http://www.sfwa.org/members/elgin/LaadanLessons/LaadanVocab0306.html) shows that not all of the words were created by Suzette Haden Elgin (the creator of Láadan) but all that are not roots in and of themselves--roots which seem to have been created rather arbitrarily--can be figured out from these roots.  For example, in the dictionary I linked, the word for beaver is &quot;eduthemid.&quot;  This contains the rood for animal, &quot;mid,&quot; and some other root, I presume &quot;eduth.&quot;  I do't know what this means, but it was constructed in this way so that someone who knew these roots but did not know the word could discern that it means beaver. &#xA;&#xA;The original creator of Láadan made a couple of arbitrary roots that could then become a lexicon through a logical process of morphology, with help from multiple other people.&#xA;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I don't think anybody has ever learned Loglan or Lojban as a native language; you could therefore argue that it was never alive in the first place.

The possibility of the Voynich manuscript being a constructed language was brought to his attention by [William Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Friedman), an expert on the manuscript. Friedman confided to Tiltman, after decades of work on it, that he thought the writing could be a form of &quot;synthetic universal language&quot;, and so the cryptographer expanded his investigation in that direction, [writing a paper on the theory](https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/tech-journals/assets/files/voynich-manuscript-mysterious.pdf).&#xA;&#xA;The basic premise behind a &quot;synthetic universal language&quot; is to use characters to represent certain logical ideas; by chaining together letters, you can create &quot;words&quot; that describe more complicated principles. By adding the appropriate prefixes and suffixes, characters can be quite powerful. Tiltman noticed that some of the patterns in the words fit this type of design. However, the evidence for this sort of construction was not strong enough, and Tiltman's analysis of the frequency of the occurrence of certain letters did not support Friedman's hypothesis.&#xA;&#xA;Tiltman also traced the historical origin of a &quot;universal language&quot;, to determine if such an idea had been bounced around early enough. However, this proved difficult, and Tiltman found no concrete examples prior to the mid-17th century. This is two centuries after the Voynich manuscript was written - sometime in the 15th century - and so *if* the manuscript was indeed written in a universal language, it would predate these universal languages by two centuries.&#xA;&#xA;Tiltman noted&#xA;&gt; It was clear that the productions of these two men [Wilkins and Dalgarno, two early proponents of universal languages] were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution. When I was&#xA;attempting to trace back the idea of universal language, I came upon a printed book entitled The Universal Character by Cave Beck, London 1657 (also printed in French in the same year). Cave Beck was one of the original members of the British Royal Society and his system was certainly a cumbersome mixture.&#xA;&#xA;Beck's writing claims that the idea of a universal language goes back to the 16th century, but this still places it many years after the manuscript's origin.  The idea of synthetic universal languages, though perhaps relatively widespread in the 17th century, simply was unknown in the 15th. This was a strike against Friedman's theory. If the Voynich manuscript was a synthetic universal language, it would have borne no relation - in time of conception of structure - to later examples.&#xA;&#xA;The universal language route is of course not the only possibility; constructed languages can take many forms.

In fact, it is likely that Linear A was used to write the pre-Greek language of Crete, and the incoming Greeks adopted this writing system for their own use, but without changing how the system fundamentally works. In doing so, they developed &quot;spelling conventions&quot; to represent sound patterns found in Greek but not in the syllabary.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; First, there are many Greek sounds that are missing in Linear B signs, such as [g], [kh], [gw], [b], [ph], [th], and [l]. To solve this problem, signs for similar sounds are used instead: p-signs are used for [p], [b], and [ph]; k-signs are used for [k], [g], and [kh]; t-signs are used for [t] and [th]; q-signs are used for [kw] and [gw]; and r-signs are used for [r] and [l]. However, while this convention was likely easily understood by ancient Mycenaean scribes, it took modern scholars a lot of theoretical analysis and work, plus comparison with later Greek dialects and reconstructed Mycenaean words to rediscover how this system works&#xA;&#xA;And more relevantly:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Another inadequacy stems from the fact that Linear B signs usually represent Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllables, but the syllabic structure of Greek allows initial consonant clusters, ending consonants, and dipthongs. In the case of a syllable with a initial consonant cluster, individual consonants in the cluster are written by a CV sign whose vowel matches the vowel of the syllable. Therefore, for example, the word tri is written as ti-ri, and khrusos as ku-ru-so. In the case of ending consonant, the situation becomes more complicated. Ending consonants such as [l], [m], [n], [r], and [s] are not usually written, whereas other consonants such as [k] and [p] are written in a way similar to initial consonants.&#xA;&#xA;So one way to represent consonant clusters in a syllabary is to pick a &quot;dummy vowel&quot; that gets read over when the word is pronounced, as in Linear B, or Japanese katakana when writing foreign words. &#xA;&#xA;The question doesn't mention just how complex the syllable structure is; if it's not _too_ complex, you can also do what Japanese hiragana does with the ん character and have a single character that represents a syllable-ending consonant. Or something like what [Brahmi](http://www.ancientscripts.com/brahmi.html) does for vowels and nasals, adding strokes and dots to represent them. Maybe if _kra_, _tra_, and _pra_ are common syllables in your language, you could have a stroke that represents an _r_ between the consonant and vowel, and add it to the characters for _ka_, _ta_, and _pa_."

I'm going to cover most of the same ground [as rotaredom's answer](https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/31/35), just in more detail.&#xA;&#xA;The book notes that there aren't really any greetings in Klingon; they're simply unnecessary. Klingon as a language is somewhat utilitarian in its application, and exchanges typically start with a straightforward statement or query by one party. Saying the Klingon equivalent of &quot;How are you doing?&quot; when you just want to figure out the new ship's departure time is simply wasteful. One answer to your question, then, would be to simply avoid a greeting. The less you talk, the less time you take up. That said, if you want to truly greet someone, you have two options. . .&#xA;&#xA;## Choice 1: Be utilitarian.&#xA;&#xA;This utilitarianism is why all Klingon &quot;greetings&quot; are just introductory phrases. **&quot;nuqneH&quot;** is the one that seems to be commonly used, as rotaredom said. Its translation is &quot;What do you want?&quot; &quot;Nuq&quot; itself can be treated as an interrogative sentence on its own, simply meaning &quot;What?&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It can also be used as the start of a sentence, such as&#xA;&gt; nuq legh yaS&#xA;&#xA;which means&#xA;&gt; What does the officer see?&#xA;&#xA;Additionally, &quot;neH&quot; is used as a form of &quot;to want&quot; (though it also used as an adverbial, to mean &quot;only&quot;). Therefore, we have the compound &quot;nuqneH&quot;, properly an exclamation that stands by itself as a sentence.&#xA;&#xA;## Choice 2: Use an honorific.&#xA;&#xA;The *Dictionary* notes that &quot;neS&quot; is the only honorific suffix in Klingon, used as part of larger words. For instance, **&quot;qaleghneS&quot;**, coming from &quot;qa&quot; (&quot;you&quot;), &quot;legh&quot; (&quot;see&quot;) and &quot;neS&quot;, translates to&#xA;&gt; I am honored to see you.&#xA;&#xA;This states a fact, and gets to the point. It *may* be used towards a superior, but this is not mandatory, and I don't think it's commonly used. If you wish to open the conversation with an inquiry, **&quot;HIja'neS&quot;** (which includes &quot;HIja&quot;, normally used as an affirmative) can work. Its translation is&#xA;&gt; Do me the honor of telling me [about something].&#xA;&#xA;Again, use this when asking a superior something, but only if you really want to be respectful.&#xA;&#xA;## Miscellaneous&#xA;&#xA;Though I have yet to see any of the following used as a greeting, I imagine you could modify them to create some sort of opening remark.&#xA;&#xA; - **&quot;bel&quot;** is the verb for &quot;to be pleased&quot;, so when greeting someone, you could conceivably say &quot;jIbel&quot; (&quot;I am pleased&quot;, with &quot;jI&quot; for first-person). Likewise, &quot;Quch&quot; is the verb for &quot;to be happy&quot;. Using &quot;jIbel&quot; or &quot;jiQuch&quot; to indicate satisfaction upon meeting someone is a possibility.&#xA; - **&quot;maj&quot;** (&quot;Good&quot;) or **&quot;majQa'&quot;** (&quot;Well done&quot;) are exclamations used as praise. You could use these - preferably &quot;majQa'&quot; - when welcoming an inferior who has successfully completed a task, like blowing up an enemy spaceship.&#xA; - **&quot;toH&quot;** is another exclamation, meaning &quot;Well!&quot; or &quot;So!&quot; You would use this in, for instance, a sentence like&#xA;   &gt; Well! I didn't expect to see you back alive.&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1 Appending &quot;Daq&quot;, to make &quot;nuqDaq&quot;, yields &quot;Where?&quot;&lt;/sup&gt;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The Sumerians wrote in cuneiform. This later got foisted on the Akkadians, the Hittites, the Iranians, etc. The Romans wrote with an alphabet, and that got foisted on just about the whole world, even those prestigious languages that have long had their own systems. Mostly as a matter of convenience to online existence.&#xA;&#xA;As a language inventor, you get to play with these forces and circumstances. And I at least advocate out several forms of writing for a language to see which you think is the better fit. Especially if you happen to be, as a matter of philosophy, a language ***inventor***.  If you happen to be a language ***discoverer***, then you might come to the realisation that such-and-such a language uses a particular system, and you'll just live with it.&#xA;&#xA;Trying out several systems at once, perhaps using a well known example text, will give you a good feel for how it meshes with the language structure. This exercise will also teach you how well (or how poorly) you understand either that kind of writing system or your own language's make-up! If you think a fixed syllable structure might benefit from a syllabary, then try it out! But if you discover that your &quot;fixed syllable structure&quot; is full of complications, exceptions, alterations, and so forth, you might find that a syllabary becomes unwieldy. That's not necessarily a bad thing --- scribes and writers have long had to deal with terribly complex writing systems (Egyptian! Sumerian! Chinese!)&#xA;&#xA;Creating a few &quot;temporary&quot; writing systems for use with any later invented language project could also be useful. Doing this, you won't have to invent a whole new syllabary, a whole new alphabet for each future language project. The actual symbols won't necessarily be the symbols that get used for any language; they're just a tool to help you evaluate compatibility.&#xA;&#xA;As for an evaluation tool, first I'd do some research into how many symbols various natural language systems have. In English, which uses an alphabet, we basically have 26 symbols. Abjads only notate consonants. So if English used an abjad, that would be 19 to 21 symbols (depending on how you count w &amp; y). At the other end is Chinese, whose logogrammes number over a hundred thousand (according to WP's citation of a modern Chinese dictionary); but you'd only need about 2000 to read a newspaper. &#xA;&#xA;This will you give a rough idea of how much work is going to go into devising characters for the invented language vs how much work is going to go into inventing the language.&#xA;&#xA;Then, you'll want to consider how different writing systems work vs how your language works. No writing system perfectly captures the sounds of any language, except for the IPA. Everything else is a compromise. A language that is heavy on nuanced content words, a logography might be too unwieldy. A language with few lexical items might be very comfortable with logogrammes. A language with lots of vowels may not get along with anything but an alphabet: is PN abjad spelling for pan, pawn, pain, pean, pen, pin, pine, pane, pone, pon, or pun?&#xA;&#xA;You'll also want to consider aesthetic qualities of the writing system. If you find cuneiform logogrammes are just the bees knees, then aesthesis might outweigh the difficulties of having to make hundreds of symbols. If calligraphy is more your style, then an alphabet or an abjad might be better choices.&#xA;&#xA;Lastly, don't neglect combination systems! If you really like the aesthetics of logograpmmes, but don't want to bother with hundreds or thousands, consider a hybrid system where certain symbols have come to take on syllabic or alphabetic function, while certain words or classes of words continue to be written using full logogrammes."

After all, it's the grammar, the syntax, the usability in a wide variety of normal contexts that determines naturalism.  A natural language might have anywhere [between 15000 and 1,000,000 words][1]. And as you can see from the several English entries, there's not even a consensus as to how many words there are in a language. The number of words you ***should*** create is entirely up to you. A more interesting question, interesting in the broad sense of course!, is *how many words is enough words to create?* This is not only more interesting to consider, but also harder to answer because there is no pat response and any answer given will be purely opinion.&#xA;&#xA;  I'd argue that 2000 is a bare bones lower estimation, given that this is the lexicon size for [Basic English][2]. But B.E. isn't exactly &quot;naturalistic&quot;, so that figure is undoubtedly low. Somewhere between 3000 and 6000 gives you a little more than dry bones to gnaw on!, but still hardly approaches the naturalism of a natural language, to say nothing of the works of the more gung ho kind of lexicophilic glossopoets!&#xA;&#xA;* As for the second question, we do have some recent figures.

The obviative is sometimes called the fourth person.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; The term fourth person is also sometimes used for **the category of indefinite or generic referents**, which work like one in English phrases such as &quot;one should be prepared&quot; or people in people say that..., when the grammar treats them differently from ordinary third-person forms. The so-called &quot;zero person&quot; in Finnish and related languages, in addition to passive voice may serve to leave the subject-referent open.

This is similar to proximate and obviative pronouns, but not identical.&#xA;&#xA;For instance, suppose all non-vocative uses of names require some kind of definite determiner. And suppose there are proximal and distal determiners (&quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;). I'm also assuming that these determiners can form NPs without an accompanying noun, like in English.&#xA;&#xA;then you could say something to the effect of&#xA;&#xA;    this Adam sent essay to that James to help that with that's writing.&#xA;&#xA;There's a lot of variation in existing natural languages when it comes to contrasts in demonstratives. Some languages surface distinctions such as visibility (e.g. Malagasy) or audibility (e.g. Khaling, a Sino-Tibetan language from Nepal) or altitude/elevation.&#xA;&#xA;-------------------------&#xA;&#xA;### 2 topic-prominence and a dedicated pronoun for referring back to the topic&#xA;&#xA;The reflexive pronoun solution described above normally tracks co-reference with the syntactic subject of the matrix clause.&#xA;&#xA;If that solution is not flexible enough, you can track co-reference with the topic instead and explicitly mark the topic in some way.&#xA;&#xA;For example, suppose James is the topic and TOP is the pronoun that refers to the topic. Let the postposition/clitic は mark the topic of a clause.&#xA;&#xA;    to James は Adam sent essay to help TOP with TOP's writing.&#xA;&#xA;Or you could do something like the following if you want は to obscure the role of the topicalized noun.&#xA;&#xA;    James は Adam sent essay to help TOP with TOP's writing.&#xA;&#xA;As far as I know, no topic prominent natural languages actually do this.&#xA;&#xA;-------------------------------&#xA;&#xA;### 3 switch reference on non-finite verbs&#xA;&#xA;Switch reference marks whether the subject of a clause is the same as the previous clause or not. Suppose each verb is marked SS for same subject or DS for different subject. I'll assume utterance-initial words are marked with `DS`.&#xA;&#xA;This requires some care in defining what exactly &quot;previous clause&quot; means.&#xA;&#xA;    Adam sent.DS essay to James to help.SS him with his writing.DS .&#xA;&#xA;so in this sentence, `sent.DS` marks that `sent` is in an utterance-initial clause. `help` receives a same subject marker because `help` and `sent` have the same subject, sort of, and writing has a `DS` marker because James is writing, not Adam.&#xA;&#xA;Getting the details right on how exactly you want pervasive switch-reference to work might be a bit tricky.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;-------------------------------&#xA;&#xA;### 4 pro-forms incorporating some feature such as the first sound of a word.&#xA;&#xA;Suppose you have some forms consisting `some constant` + `ona`, which can refer back to a noun beginning with that particular consonant sound (or `ona` itself if the word begins with a vowel). Then you can do something like:&#xA;&#xA;    Adam sent essay to James to help JONA with JONA's writing.&#xA;&#xA;the choice of `JONA` over `ONA` means that James is the one whose writing we're attempting to improve."

Japanese and Chinese have nothing in common, yet when the Chinese writing system made it to Japan over 1000 years ago it was the only one they had. Initially, it was used only to write Chinese, but then it was developed into a system suitable to write Japanese via many intermediate steps and multiple parallel paths. Now, centuries later, Japanese has:&#xA;&#xA; - some characters that are identical to (traditional) Chinese ones with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 大 (large) or 中 (centre)&#xA; - some characters whose written forms have been simplified from traditional Chinese but with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 国 (state) 売 (to sell)&#xA; - two sets of characters that are radically simplified/modified from their traditional forms and used only for their phonetic value (katakana and hiragana)&#xA; - some characters whose written forms are as in traditional Chinese but whose meanings have departed. The best example I could find was 豚 which means *pig* in Japanese but *piglet* in Chinese.&#xA;&#xA;   (Of course, some characters’ meanings departed in Chinese while they are still used in their original sense in Japanese like 湯 (*hot water* in Japanese and old Chinese; *soup* in modern Chinese; they shouldn’t be listed in a separate bullet point because they generally fit the first)&#xA;&#xA; - compound words composed of more than one character with a meaning akin to the Chinese one&#xA;&#xA; - compound words composed of more than one character with a completely different meaning (手紙 which in Japanese means *letter* (the one you send) but in Chinese is toilet paper)&#xA;&#xA; - entirely newly created written compounds, often spelt with hiragana and kanji to better reproduce Japanese grammar&#xA;&#xA; - new characters created by combining individual parts, e.g. 働 (to work) made from the individual symbols 人 (man, person) and 動 (to move); the former regularly becomes a ‘pole with a steep hat’ in compounds such as 休&#xA;&#xA;As Japanese and Chinese are linguistically so different (Chinese can have closed syllables, it has tones, the vowel registers differ and more), the Japanese pronunciation of Chinese characters obviously differs substantially from their original at the time of borrowing. In general, most characters can be pronounced in two or more ways depending on their surrounding. These pronunciations are grouped into *kun* (have nothing to do with the Chinese original pronunciation; this is a Japanese word with a similar or identical meaning) and *on* (more or less loosely modelled on the Chinese pronunciation when the character was borrowed which may have happened more than once). However, even *on* pronunciations can be considered a simplification at best; a bastardisation of th original pronunciation may be more accurate.&#xA;&#xA;Differences notwithstanding, I know one Chinese who claims to be able to get the basic gist of written Japanese and with some crude knowledge of Japanese I was able to grasp the meanings of some things written in Chinese on Taiwan recently.

Assume English had no reflexives. &quot;I tossed the ball to I&quot; and &quot;You tossed the ball to you&quot; (assuming singular &quot;you&quot;) are quite understandable as one person tossing the ball to themselves, thus no reflexive needed. &quot;She tossed the ball to he&quot;, acceptable. But suppose you had &quot;She tossed the ball to she&quot;, and it's been previously established there is more than one woman present. Did person A throw the ball to Person B, or did she toss the ball up in the air and caught it herself? There's no way to tell. An example like that is why German only has a distinctive reflexive in third person; first and second person don't have that same ambiguity.&#xA;&#xA;You can get rid of the reflexive entirely if your verb system, to use one possibility, allows a given verb to indicate if it takes a direct or indirect object, or if it does not. Let's say that English verbs used the affix *a-* to indicate the verb is ditransitive (it has both a direct and indirect object) and no affix to indicate purely transitive (it only has a direct object).&#xA;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She a-threw the ball to she.&quot; - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she.&quot; - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&#xA;&#xA;Under a system like that, English wouldn't need a reflexive pronoun because the verb would make it clear whether the subject was performing the action on themselves, or using themselves as the indirect object, or whether something else was the recipient of the action. One could argue the affix *a-* is similar to the single Icelandic reflexive pronoun that's used for everything.&#xA;&#xA;In Inuktitut, verbs that are are equivalent to English intransitive verbs use one suffix attached to them to indicate the subject:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; pisuk *to walk*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; pisuktunga *I am walking*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; pisuktutit *You (singular) are walking*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; pisuktuq *He/She/It is walking*&#xA;&#xA;Specific verbs, equivalent to transitive verbs, use a different set of suffixes that indicate both subject and object:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; qukiq *to shoot something*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtagit *I shoot you*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtara *I shoot him/her/it*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtarma *You shoot me*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtait *You shoot him/her/it*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtaanga *He/she/it shoot me*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtaatit *He/she/it shoot you*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtanga *He/she/it shoot that other he/she/it*&#xA;&#xA;Here's where the reflexives come in: if you don't use the second set of suffixes, but instead use the first set, then the verb becomes a reflexive: the subject did something to themselves.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtunga *I shoot myself*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtutit *You shoot yourself*&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; qukiqtuq *He/She/It shoot themself*&#xA;&#xA;Attaching the suffix that goes on intransitive verbs onto a transitive verb turns that verb into a reflexive.&#xA;&#xA;So, if your verb conjugation allows that sort of thing, then you can get away with not using reflexive pronouns. The verb indicates it.&#xA;&#xA;On the other hand, if your verb doesn't allow you to do that, then you need reflexives in order to remove the ambiguity when you get into situations where it's not clear who is doing what to whom. &#xA;&#xA;Another way: go back to that first English example I used. Suppose English had multiple third person singular pronouns, such that you didn't just have &quot;she&quot;, but &quot;she-1&quot;, &quot;she-2&quot;, and perhaps more. Then what does the example look like?&#xA;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-2.&quot; - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-1.&quot; - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&#xA;&#xA;No ambiguity. The context makes it clear that Mary is she-1 (Mary had the ball, she-1 threw the ball, therefore Mary is she-1, so Susan is she-2).&#xA;&#xA;A third option is context. You might have a language where you do need to gather more information in order to determine what's going on.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan threw it back.&quot; - Mary obviously threw the ball to Susan.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan then asked for the ball.&quot; - Mary apparently didn't throw the ball to Susan, since Susan asked for it after it had been thrown and caught.&#xA;&#xA;So, three possible ways to get away without reflexive pronouns. So it's not a matter of how common or uncommon it is, but does the grammar of the language allow you to get away without them, or is it necessary because there's no other way of providing the same information?"

While what you're considering is unusual, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't just be a written language in a logographic script.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; - is purely for reading and writing&#xA;&gt; - has no need to be spoken and is thus not based upon letters/phonemes&#xA;&gt; - is not meant to be signed, hummed, whistled, grunted, tapped or transmitted in any other way except for being printed on, and read from, a two-dimensional surface&#xA;&#xA;It has no need to be, sure. But if humans or human-like beings are there they would most likely develop an oral way of &quot;reading&quot; it eventually.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; - uses symbols to represent concepts&#xA;&gt; - each symbol/concept corresponds to something like an English word or sentence (e.g. 'a cat', 'the sound made by flying bees', 'the feeling that results from being beaten by a lesser foe', 'move quickly', 'why?')&#xA;&gt; - symbols are highly domain-specific and exclusive — mining, carpentry, fishing, etc. would have exclusive symbols that only have meaning in their contexts&#xA;&#xA;Sounds like a logographic writing system. Now it's not clear if the symbols for phrases are made up of component symbols for the things they represent or are unique singular symbols. Building symbols from other symbols would make sense, otherwise the number of symbols would grow exponentially.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; - symbols are arranged relative to each other (in 2D space) to communicate more complex concepts and provide context&#xA;&#xA;This is on the surface the biggest difference between your proposal and human languages, which for both spoken and written language are linear.&#xA;&#xA;However consider that some branches of linguistics believe that all language is representable by binary trees alone. If your language has a syntax (and if it doesn't it really couldn't be considered language) then we'd expect that it would be possible to develop a tree-based representation of it, perhaps using multiple levels of deep structure below the surface. And a non-binary tree could be converted to a binary tree.&#xA;&#xA;I just spent some time looking at 2D languages, both conlangs and programming languages, and all the ones I found consisted of linear paths to follow or a tree structure. Conlangger Sai [has explained their ideas for a non-linear fully 2D writing system](https://s.ai/essays/nlf2dws), but they don't give an example of such a writing system. But they do say that their version of non-linearity is distinguished from linear design systems only by inelegance or convolution. I'd take this to mean that actually it is serialisable (and therefore could in theory be spoken) if not by humans then by some being of great intelligence. The essay is worth reading anyway if this topic continues to interest you.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; In fact, I believe I can say that it is not possible, short of crippled or very simple specialty cases, to directly convert a linear writing to a non-linear one without either loosing a lot of meaning (NLàL), being extremely inelegant by virtue of failing to take advantage of better design (LàNL), or becoming functionally incomprehensible (e.g. the list format in which an Nth-degree array is stored in the C programming language).&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; So, what is non-linearity?&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; At its core, NL has to do with how concepts are arranged, both on physical paper and in their more abstract form. A NL system is a multigraph; its components are, or can be, extremely interconnected. There is no single traversal method, though there may be some conventional ones. There may not be a ‘traversal’ method at all, as such;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

To indicate other tenses (preterite/past imperfect/subjunctive/future/etc) I use the combined phrase &quot;sona,&quot; meaning &quot;in (the) time (of)&quot; and then adding a various suffix to indicate the specific tense(&quot;sonasato&quot;=&quot;in time past&quot;). This means I only have the present tense of conjugations per verb, not changing the actions of the subject per tense. (In English, you have &quot;I eat&quot; (present) and &quot;I ate&quot; (past), as one example. In my conlang, you use &quot;In the time of past, I eat.&quot; (Past, but using a present conjugation.) What I'm wondering about are the places where I should put this simple tense indicator in a sentence. The conlang's sentence structure is like this (using an example from English as translation):&#xA;English:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;The dog drank from a bowl of water.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The dog(determiner+noun)-&gt; drinks (conjugated verb, &quot;it drinks&quot;) from (preposition) a bowl (determiner+noun) of (preposition) water (noun). &#xA;&#xA;In my conlang, you would say&#xA;&#xA;Sepyew (&quot;(it) drinks&quot;, conjugated form of &quot;to drink&quot; in present tense) eu bítõe (the dog) de è roum (from a bowl, this would be contracted into &quot;dè roum&quot; or &quot;dèroum.&quot;) de aqua (of water.)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This, however, was the present tense. The past tense (The dog _drank_ from a bowl of water) involves the &quot;sonasato&quot;(in the past tense)  in some form, but I don't know where the most logical place to place it would be. Ordinarily, that wouldn't present a problem.&#xA;&#xA;Unfortunately, my conlang has no punctuation, that is to say, sentences are one long string of words. I've not considered how to handle this with dialogue, but otherwise it hasn't presented a problem until now.  Pauses for breath within conversation are natural, but I'm **addressing this question from the written aspect of language**. Because the sentences are fluid, I don't know how to handle the abrupt changes between tenses other than using the &quot;sona&quot; variants excessively. And the rules of the language mean that the tense is always expressed, per statement (not sentence, because of the punctuation) by either ignoring the sona rule (indicating the present tense) or by using it (to indicate some other tense.) &#xA;&#xA;# Question&#xA;&#xA;Keeping that in mind, what would be the most logical place to place the tense indicator so that I can change it relatively easily between tenses in a language with no periods or commas (pauses), and where?&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you want to get really fancy, you can try to find a pre-made computational morphological model for the source language (e.g., a PC-KIMMO or KLEENE or HFST file) and then generate random underlying forms to run through it, but that probably does start to get into the realm of &quot;an insane amount of linguistics&quot;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of decent middle ground, rather than copying the source language morphology. One is to generate a bunch of short, one-or-two-syllable con-morphemes of your own that match the source phonology, and then use those as the base units from which you generate conlang words, rather than going directly from the phonology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another is to try to imitate the source language phonemic distribution. For that, you basically just need a big list of source language words, from which you can extract statistical information. The simplest way to do that is to just count up occurrences of each phoneme, but if you know a little bit more statistics, or are willing to learn, you can construct a conditional distribution model for which phonemes occur most often in different particular positions, and then generate random words based on those specialized distributions, rather than the default uniform distribution. Awkwords can't handle that kind of model sophistication, but other word generators, like [Logopoeist][3], can, and it's also not too hard to write up a custom generator just for your particular naming language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl#Phonology&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://akana.conlang.org/tools/awkwords/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://github.com/conlang-software-dev/Logopoeist&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Narrow the focus of a verb by adding some sort of descriptor to it. You may want to incorporate tools, for example. In Nahuatl, such incorporation often translate to &quot;X like (a) Y(s)&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Allow an otherwise oblique argument (usually of a semantically, if not syntactically [labile verb][3]) to become its subject (cf. English, &quot;My head aches&quot; vs. &quot;I have a headache&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Background an argument that has already been mentioned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Adding a classifier of some sort. This is an integral part of verbal morphology in the Algonquian Languages, for example.

In many of these languages, adjectives take the form of descriptive verbs or adjunct nouns that can themselves be incorporated into themain noun (cf. English Bluebeard, whiteboard, blackbird...), and syntactically, it doesn't typically work to incorporate an entire relative sentence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, some languages, such as Chukchi *do allow for the whole noun+adjective* phrase to be incorporated, and quite a few languages *allow for numeral markers to be incorporated*, although this is actually part of the verbal paradigm itself i.e. if you incorporate &quot;I saw two persons&quot; you are incorporating the noun &quot;person&quot; to a verb root that means &quot;see two X&quot;, not incorporating &quot;two men&quot;.

They aren't really strict implications so much as Stuff You Might Consider Thinking About™. I think the effects of choosing secundative alignment are pretty local overall and won't have cascading effects on your grammar. In my opinion, the thorniest issue here is dealing with valence-changing operations on verbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - What do secundative languages tend to look like in the real world?&#xD;&#xA; - How does secundative alignment manifest itself in morphology or syntax?&#xD;&#xA; - Valence-changing operations&#xD;&#xA; - Relative Clauses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Real World Secundative Languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want your language to be naturalistic, I suggest taking a look at WALS to see what kinds of combinations of features are typologically uncommon. If you are not trying to make a naturalistic language, knowing what natural languages tend to do is a good way to spend your &quot;weirdness budget&quot; wisely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This map][1] marks the strategy used for the verb `to give`. This analysis could be misleading because it's possible for the verb `give` to use a different strategy from other verbs, but I think this feature is the best fit for what you're after of the available WALS features.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at the map, my assessment of the _broad_ areal trends is that Eurasia is dominated by the indirect object construction. The secondary object construction seems to be common in North America and in New Guinea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The WALS Chapter for this feature][2] provides some examples of the different types of constructions as well as a note about what other features commonly co-occur with secondary object marking, excerpt below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...head-marking languages with verb indexing of two core arguments tend&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to show the secondary-object pattern...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does secundative alignment manifest itself?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, there are four ways your language can manifest secundative alignment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - word order&#xD;&#xA; - presence of dedicated adpositions&#xD;&#xA; - case markers&#xD;&#xA; - verbal agreement&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think most of the real world secundative languages are secundative because the recipient in the verb `to give` or other similar verbs gets indexed in the verb the same way that a prototypical direct object would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This can occur in a language with no case marking. So, I give you the book might be something like&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    book.sg  give.1sg-subj.2sg-obj&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this example, book bears no case marking but is clearly the theme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The case marking strategy is covered in your example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For word order, we can take an example from English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I give you the book&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`you` is the recipient, but occupies the position directly after the verb. In English you have a choice between using a preposition like `to` or `for` instead. If no such option existed, this would be a pristine example of syntactic secundativeness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the language can be _partially secundative_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, the following is possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    you.sg.DAT book.sg.ACC give.1sg-subj.2sg-obj&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this example, the two non-agent arguments `book` and `give` receive indirect-object-style case marking, but the verb shows secundative alignment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Valence changing operations&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to think about how the _passive voice_, if it exists, should behave.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose we have a language with secundative alignment in its cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.NOM you.OBJ book.INST give.PST&#xD;&#xA;    I gave you a book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you were to passivize the verb, which argument would be promoted to the agent?

As far as I know, _anti-applicative_ voices do not exist in the real world, but [applicative voice][3] does exist. It's possible to allow this promotion without an explicit voice for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.NOM book.OBJ give.ANTIAPP.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This situation gets murkier if the language is both ergative and secundative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ERG you.ABS book.INST give.PST&#xD;&#xA;    I gave the book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the antipassive voice would delete the absolutive argument and promote the ergative argument.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ABS book.INST give.ANTIPSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;    I gave the book (to someone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some ergative languages mark instruments and agents the same way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ERG book.ERG you.ABS give.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the antipassive voice could potentially target either argument.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    I.ABS give.ANTIPSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    book.ABS give.ANTIPSV.PST&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Relative clauses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Deciding how relative clauses in secundative languages should work might present some subtle issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Languages frequently have a limit on what kinds of arguments can be targeted by relative clauses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may want to choose to make only the agent and the primary object extractable, but not secondary objects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://wals.info/combinations/105A?v2=dff0#3/10.14/148.89&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://wals.info/chapter/105&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_voice" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

They're blocks, and there are 96 of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You allow for 96^2 and 96^3 combos, which is nearly 900,000 blocks or polyblocks.  That's plenty of room to define a language.  That's bigger than many lexicons, and you can certainly spare a large subset for grammatical functions.  Chinese for example is said to have 50,000 characters --- yes those are graphemes and there's apples and oranges here, but you take the point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine a person who only speaks and writes Chinese and has no awareness that other languages even exist.  One day they are told, you can write everything in a language using 26 letters and some punctuation and so forth, you can get away with old-school ASCII with a maximum of 256 graphemes!

A community where throat singing is practiced may carry over the some biphonic distinguishing features to their language.

Acoustically, vowels (and most sounds, actually) are simply combinations of [formants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant): specific frequencies at which the vocal tract resonates. The differences between vowels are then caused by differences in the frequencies of the formants. This can be easily seen on a _spectrogram_, like this one from Wikipedia:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![formant image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Spectrogram_-iua-.png)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this spectrogram, the vowel [i] has its first two formants at roughly 500 and 2500 Hz, while [u] has its first two formants at roughly 500 and 1000 Hz.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, it turns out that biphonic singing works on exactly the same principle! Biphonic singing works through shaping the mouth so that one of the formants becomes loud enough to be perceived as a separate note. Note that this uses exactly the same mechanism used in vocalising vowels; the only difference is that the shape of the mouth is changed slightly to emphasise the formants. To experience this yourself, you can try saying [u͡ʉ͡y͡ʉ͡u] very slowly; if you listen carefully to what you are saying, you should be able to hear a note growing higher and then lower in pitch. This note is one of the formants of the vowels (the first formant, I think); Biphonic singers simply emphasise this formant so it becomes loud enough to easily hear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to summarise, languages already use vowels which could be described as ‘biphonic’ — the only reason we don’t hear it that way is because the formants aren’t as strong as they are in biphonic singing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(For more information, you may find https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/voice.html and https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/xoomi.html interesting.)"

Originally, there were feminine forms such as *philosophesse* in widespread use, but in the 1600s, around the time L'Académie was founded, the idea that &quot;the masculine prevails over the feminine&quot; became a standard French published grammars and dictionaries used, and they explicitly declared this to be the case not because it was an existing linguistic rule in French but because the language should reflect the &quot;natural&quot; male-dominant society of the time. So words such as *la philosophesse* was declared grammatically incorrect: *le philosophe* was the only proper term. (Besides, they probably chuckled, it's not like the little ladies could really think anyway, amirite?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No really, they said that. And L'Académie, who still don't like girl cooties, was on board and kept enforcing that. So you'd see situations where, for instance, if you had an symphony orchestra of entirely female musicians, they'd be referred to as *les musiciennes* (fem.pl). If they added a single man to the orchestra, now the group is *les musiciens* (masc.pl), even though the man is outnumbered 100:1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The blowback happening now, which *les immortels* (of course, never *les immortelles*) are fighting hard against, is to tweak French to be a bit more inclusive, by doing things like creating constructions analogous to the &quot;Latinx&quot; term, changing some nouns so that the feminine form is fully accepted as grammatically equal to the male, and perhaps even considered the default; to use an example I just made up, if you referred &quot;an engineer&quot; as a generic, you'd use *une ingénieure* instead of *un ingénieur*.

If you have a &quot;message&quot; with just one bit of information, you can express two meanings, which are &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. If you want to express more complex ideas, you need a longer message. For example, if you want to express the decimal numbers from 0 to 15 in binary, you need at least four bits to represent them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We as people have created a system where we know beforehand what the bits mean when we send and receive them. So if we send a message consisting of four binary digits, e.g. &quot;0010&quot;, then we know that that means the number &quot;2&quot;, because that's the convention we've agreed upon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So you could certainly expand this principle by using three signs instead of two, and use conventions and codes to create meanings. The snag is that the complexity of the message would increase massively. For example, if I want to write the word &quot;message&quot; in English, I only need a total of seven symbols, and each symbol can be one of 26 signs (the English alphabet.) If I want to write the word &quot;message&quot; in binary, however, it will look like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 0110110101100101011100110111001101110011011000010110011101100101&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which is a considerably longer message, because I only have two signs to work with, not 26.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other disadvantage is: you need a convention or a &quot;code&quot; which both the sender of the message (the speaker) and the receiver (the listener) to be understood before a message can be transmitted. If you saw the above binary sequence out of context, you would have no way of knowing it meant &quot;message&quot;, because I haven't told you that it represents a sequence of ASCII characters. It could just be meaningless computer code, or a very large number, or part of a recipe for a salmon bake.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So you could theoretically create a language with three &quot;signs&quot; and combine them to make meanings. For example, if your words were &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;ol&quot;, then you could have the following sequences:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    kapi = woman&#xD;&#xA;    kapiol = man&#xD;&#xA;    olka = cat&#xD;&#xA;    olpipika = dog&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And so on. But you would have two problems with such a language:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The complexity of each resulting &quot;word&quot; would vastly increase as you make the message longer, and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. There's no obvious relation between your signs and your word, so you would have to make your messages understood by pre-existing codes, agreed between the speaker and listener."

As you obtain higher and higher levels of information density, you have to sacrifice some naturalism or some simplicity in order to get there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Marking the point where you've sacrificed too much naturalism or simplicity to be learnable is a judgment call.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Short answer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Possibly guaspi, but it's obscure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One famous example of this is [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/). Parts of Ithkuil are reasonably naturalistic, such as [its phonology](http://www.ithkuil.net/01_phonology.html), which is less complex than [Ubykh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubykh_phonology) or [Chechen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_language#Phonology) (which also has a large number of vowels). Other parts are not, such as [the very fine-grained case distinctions](http://www.ithkuil.net/04_case.html) or [how meanings are organized into roots](http://www.ithkuil.net/10_lexico-semantics.html), which is more complex than the system of triliteral roots in Semitic languages that it is based on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is Ithkuil learnable? I really don't know. My guess is `no` but I don't have proof.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example of an informationally-dense written language is [Classical Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese_grammar). Classical Chinese is not a conlang, but it *was written centuries* after it stopped being spoken and *uses a heavily abbreviated style where nearly everything that's pragmatically inferable is dropped*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to make an informationally dense conlang, Classical Chinese is a good starting point. It has pervasive zero marking (although you can optionally mark possessors and relative clauses with an overt marker) and the reconstructed roots are monosyllabic or [sesquisyllabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_syllable).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One possible example of an *intentionally information dense language* is [guaspi](http://www.jfcarter.net/~jimc/guaspi/grammar.html), a tonal derivative of lojban.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know whether lojban is considered learnable or not and I don't know whether to consider guaspi successful or not, but efficiency is one of its stated goals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Gua\spi is efficient. Words are short, and extensive defaults on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; articles and modal cases eliminate the majority of structure words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt, a human can speak &quot;informal&quot; lojban riddled with logic errors and this should count as speaking lojban.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closing remarks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at some of these examples reveals an *important design decision* that creators of an informationally-dense language face: whether to allow the speaker to drop things that are pragmatically inferable and how to account for that when evaluating how well their language achieves its goals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, suppose a language has very specific tenses that are marked on all verbs or person marking on all verbs. Tense information is frequently recoverable from context, as are pronominal arguments. If information is recoverable from context, does the language *get any points* for encoding it directly, however efficiently it may do so?" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This makes for efficient communication in perfect conditions, but as soon as there is any noise (in the widest sense of 'noise'), communication could get disrupted. If any symbol is changed during transmission (ie misheard, or dropped), then the meaning of your message will change in a way that cannot be recovered. It would also require perfect production, ie no typos or other mistakes, as they would all change the meaning. Because there is no redundancy, you cannot even recognise a typo, as it would simply be another, different, word. That of course is in the extreme case only. Imagine you numbered all the words in your dictionary and would simply transmit a sequence of numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another aspect of information density is not in the language but the texts created in the language. Any text requires shared context between author and recipient for the receiver to be able to interpret the message. Anything not shared between the sender and receiver needs to be contained in the message itself. So even if your language itself is very information dense (or redundant), your messages don't have to be the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is probably a natural limit for information density in human languages. If every letter you write has an impact on the meaning of your message, you need a huge cognitive effort to create it (either when learning the language, or when writing a text in it). And similarly, the receiver needs to spend a lot of effort into decoding/understanding your message. So while it is space efficient (you get away with shorter messages), the time efficiency is pretty poor. And if your message content gets lost in the process, you need to re-transmit, which adds to that as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For those reasons languages tend not to be on the extremes of density (or redundancy). And any conlangs that would go there, would be hard to use. So it doesn't really make sense to have this as a design goal for a language." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It also serves to rule out other possible readings such as the tautological `bad people are bad`. Here `ike` is used as &quot;commit evil acts&quot;, one of which is presumably hating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I interpret `Haters gonna hate` as a phrase for dismissing all criticism as inevitable or unfounded regardless of its content.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think `hate` in this context literally refers to feeling hatred/enmity, but to [`hating on`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hate_on), which is not quite the same thing and covers things like insults and ridicule.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we strip out a lot of the detail of `haters gonna hate` and get something reasonable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    jan    ike    li   ike&#xD;&#xA;    person bad    PRED bad&#xD;&#xA;    bad    people are  bad&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since `jan ike` is so much broader than `bad person` in English, I think this does a good job of conveying the intent of the expression.

A word of 10 syllables, 6 morphenes. What, precisely, is the advantage over &quot;didn't want to be made to go&quot; (8 syllables, and 8 morphenes)? It only works if you decide that &quot;word&quot; is the most basic unit to measure against, but &quot;word&quot; can be a very arbitrary concept.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[In a 2010 paper][1], a study was done looking at the &quot;information density&quot; of speech; that is, given the same text translated into multiple languages, so everyone is conveying the same information, how long would it take a fluent speaker of that language to transmit that information, speaking at a normal cadence (and using multiple speakers to get an average, of course). As part of that process, one step was determining how much information was conveyed per syllable. They used Vietnamese as a baseline, arbitrarily giving it a value of 1.00. If a language conveyed the same information in more syllables than Vietnamese, it would be lower than 1 (you need more syllables to communicate the same information). English was 0.91. Japanese was 0.49. In other words, you needed nearly twice as many syllables to communicate the same thing in Japanese as you did in English, Mandarin (0.94), or obviously Vietnamese (1.00).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you compare speaking rates (how fast those syllables are spoken), it turns out that most languages are about the same when it comes to transmitting information per time, between 0.9 and 1.1 (Vietnamese again being 1.00). Except Japanese, which although having easily the fastest speaking rate of the languages tested, because of the extremely low density of information per syllable, they had the lowest rate of transmission by far, at 0.74.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So Japanese is significantly *less* information dense than many other widely spoken languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You see the same thing in other agglutinative languages. Just because a given language can pack more information into a single word doesn't mean that it will necessarily be shorter to communicate. I work with Inuktitut translations all the time, and I just pulled up an example I've dealt with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Proponent intends to conduct a mineral exploration program including drilling, sampling, magnetic surveying, and mapping.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Inuktitut translation is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ᐱᓕᕆᔪᒪᔪᖅ ᐅᔭᕋᖕᓂᐊᕐᕕᒃᓴᖅᓯᐅᕈᒪᒐᒥ ᐱᓕᕆᓇᔭᖅᓱᓂ ᐃᑰᑕᖃᕐᓂᖅ, ᐲᔭᐃᖃᑕᕐᓂᖅ ᖃᐅᔨᓴᒐᒃᓴᓂᒃ, ᓇᐅᒃᑯᑦ ᓂᐱᖓᓂᖃᕐᓂᖏᓐᓂᒃ ᓄᓇᐅᑉ ᐃᓗᐊᒍᑦ ᐅᔭᕋᖏᑦ ᐊᒻᒪᓗ ᓄᓇᖑᓕᐅᓂᕐᒥᒃ.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which transliterates as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Pilirijumajuq ujarangniarviksaqsiurumagami pilirinajaqsuni ikuutaqarniq, piijaiqatarniq qaujisagaksanik, naukkut nipinganiqarninginnik nunaup iluagut ujarangit ammalu nunanguliunirmik.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously the English is much more concise simply based on inspection even though it has more words. Now, an argument can be made that the English has some terms which might require a longer word to explain it in Inuktitut, so that's a fair argument. So here is a more &quot;common language&quot; example from the Government of Nunavut's website (https://livehealthy.gov.nu.ca/en/health-topics/injuries/preparing-hunt-land):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Telling someone at home where you are going. Even if you are going&#xD;&#xA;&gt; out on the land for just a few hours, you should tell at least one&#xD;&#xA;&gt; person at home the names of all riders and passengers, where you are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; going, and when you plan to come back. If you do not return in time,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this person will be able to send for help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And here is the Innuinaqtun version:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Uqaqlugu kimut humungauliqtutin. Aulaaqhimanahuaqtillutin ikituni&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ikaangnini, uqaqtukhauyutin atauhinaugumi inuk aimavingni kitkut&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aulaaqatiniatatin, humungauliktutin, humi utiqnahuaqtuninlu.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Uttinngitkuvin mikhaatigun, tamna inuk ikayutikhangnik&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aullaqtittniaqtuq.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Innuinaqtun is 21 words compared to the English 67. If, however, you look at the *syllables*, there's 109 compared to English's 73. English clearly has the higher information density per syllable. Just because the average word is longer doesn't make the language more information dense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part of the issue with Inuktitut, just as with Japanese, is that the number of possible different syllables is limited due to the phonotactics of the language, which means you have to use more syllables to compensate for the limited inventory you have. Standard Inuktitut has at most 210 possible syllables. Japanese has, depending on who you ask, about 400 possible syllables, so you could have that number of possible one-syllable words. With English phototactics, for &quot;standard&quot; English, you have about *316,800* possible one-syllable words (there is about 9,300 in use).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason for this difference is the number of consonant clusters allowed and the ridiculous number of vowels in most English dialects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;tl;dr summary: to have a more information dense and still practical language (so you allow some natural redundancy and not have so many near-homonyms that mininterpretation due to missing something is a constant problem), you need a language with a lot of possible syllables and phonotactics that allow those syllables to be used or combined into sufficiently many distinct morphenes, however you put those morphemes together or not in any kind of language, whether isolating or agglutinative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://muse.jhu.edu/article/449938/pdf" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

At that point, I believe there really is only one viable option: Rotating one of the scripts entirely. Yes, the one you rotate *will* be a bit misrepresented, but it works. For an example, see this picture from what seems to be a French book on the Mongolian language:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![A picture from what appears to be a French book on the Mongolian language, where the Mongolian writing that uses the traditional (vertical) alphabet is displayed in-line by rotating it 90 degrees, probably counterclockwise][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr50/mongolian_horizontal.png&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is *not* me trying to discourage you to change, or even downplay, your conlang's directionality. Indeed, rotating the English is also an option. Though I'd probably suggest rotating whichever one features the least, and from your snippet that seems to be the Atili.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One last thing to keep in mind.  &#xD;&#xA;If Atili text runs top-to-bottom right-to-left like Chinese traditionally did (or bottom-to-top left-to-right), rotating it 90 degrees to match Latin alphabet text is simple, as is doing the opposite. But if it runs top-to-bottom right-to-left like traditional Mongolian (or bottom-to-top left-to-right), it gets a little bit more complicated. Assuming you rotate the Atili, then it either ends up as right-to-left text in the middle of your left-to-right Latin script text or you end up with the side normally facing the next line being the upper side rather than the lower side - neither is ideal, but either is fine.  &#xD;&#xA;The book from the example picture seems to have gone with the latter approach."

The Jawi script used to write Malay even uses ي for both /i/, /e/ and /ɛ/. Urdu uses two different symbols, ے (which is based on ي) and ہ (which isn't).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't really speak in terms of how recognizable any of this would be to Arabic-speakers of course, but since multiple languages that needed an /e/-like letter reached for ي, it seems reasonable to suggest that approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But things are never simple - ە is also quite common. For example, you mentioned Kurdish which uses it to represent /ɛ/ (which is not /e/, but pretty similar), and Persian also uses it for /e/. And as I said earlier, Urdu does use ہ (based on ه), though I believe ے is more common (except word-intially, where it can't appear).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me like some twist on ي is the most common across languages, but which one to pick is not obvious (though I expect they'd all be about equally clear to someone who isn't already familiar with one of them). ە is more uniform, but might be a bit less common, and in languages that use both (like Uyghur and Kurdish) it seems that the ي variant usually represents /e/, while ە is something like /ɛ/.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I'd probably suggest ێ, but either option seems reasonable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: [Arabic script § Additional letters used in other languages (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script#Additional_letters_used_in_other_languages) (and various language and script articles mostly linked to from there)" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Many features can be expressed in different ways, lexically, through morphology, or through syntax. For example, 'subject' could be done through a particle, an affix, or through the position in the sentence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You first come up with the list of features, and then you look at the inventory of forms in the grammar. Do you want a complex morphology? English, for example, marks very few features through morphology (plural for nouns, 3rd person singular for verbs, tenses, &amp;hellip;) and a lot through word order or by adding auxiliaries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The inventory will define the shape of your language; you can also start with that and then assign features to it. But be clear what kind of features you want to be able to express &amp;ndash; not every possible distinction needs to be expressed in language. Do you want to mark the gender of the subject in the verb? Perfectly possible, but probably not very useful, unless your language is for a very gender-segregated society.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, the more features you want to express, the more complex your grammar will be. As an extreme example, toki pona pretty much only uses word order and a few particles to distinguish between subject/verb/object, and ignores number or gender markers. In Esperanto most work is done by the morphology, which encodes the role in the sentence, gender of nouns, number, and even a range of semantic relationships (eg &quot;room where you do a particular action&quot;)."

The first question you should ask yourself is &quot;_Do I want to have an analytic, agglutinative, fusional, or polysynthetic language?_&quot; This will decide whether your language will be making sentences by putting a lot of words together in a specific order (like English or Mandarin), putting a bunch of affixes on a moderate number of words (like Korean or Navajo), putting a few very specific affixes on a moderate number of words (like Spanish or German), or stringing together a large number of component pieces to make a few very specific words (like Coptic or West Greenlandic). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next, you should ask &quot;_Should my language be primarily head-initial or head-final?_&quot; A head-initial language will probably have Verb-Subject-Object or Subject-Verb-Object word order, put auxiliary verbs before matrix verbs (e.g. _have gone_), use prepositions (e.g. _at home_), put adjectives after the nouns they modify (e.g. _house new_), and mark the start of a relative clause. A head-final language will probably have Subject-Object-Verb word order, put matrix verbs before auxiliaries (e.g. _gone have_), use postpositions (e.g. _home at_), put adjectives before the nouns they modify (e.g. _new house_), and mark the end of a relative clause. Of course, as these examples show, you don't have to pick one exclusively, but nearly all languages are predominantly one or the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, you should ask &quot;_Should my language be primarily head-marking or dependent-marking?_&quot; A head-marking language will be more likely to use polypersonal agreement instead of case marking, mark possessa instead of possessors, and have adpositions that agree with their referents. A dependent-marking language will be more likely to have case marking, mark possessors instead of possessa, and have demonstratives and adjectives that agree with their referents. Again, you don't have to go all in here, but you should lean either one way or the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For these last two especially, it's very helpful to learn which word is going to be the head of a given phrase. For example, the head of a sentence is the verb, the head of a noun phrase is the noun, the head of an adpositional phrase is the adposition, the head of a possessive construction is the possessum, etc. These aren't really intuitive (at least to me), so it's best to just memorize them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Knowing these three things right from the start will help you avoid some of the most common typological pitfalls that will make your language feel clunky to use. But choose carefully, because these choices will end up so ingrained in the language that it will be a royal pain to try to change them later. From here, you can move to making more specific decisions, like what grammatical distinctions you actually want to make, and how specifically you're going to make those distinctions."

There are a couple of ways around the problems that were mentioned. The first way is to have a highly inflectional language; this would give an explanation for why words are similar, but the words would get longer. Because you would already be expecting to have longer words, this could at least be turned into a feature rather than a detriment. The second way is to allow for less 'traditional', let's say, syllable structures. Think of the English word 'strengths' (/stɹeŋθs/) which has a CCCVCCC structure. Using a much more restrictive (C)V(N) will only make the generations of new words more difficult.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another problem is the potential overlap of meaning. The word *moku* in toki pona basically means *to Ingest* but it also means *something that is ingestible* (to Eat, to Drink, Food, Beverage). If you don't mind having words having a number of meanings which are generally related, then this shouldn't be a problem. If you want a free couple of words, don't put 'to Be', 'of/from', or (more extremely) 'to Have' into the language. That will save you 3 words right there for different concepts."

The chosen text consists of the first ten articles of the French Revolutionary [Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen), as [given by the Spanish Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Declaración_de_los_Derechos_del_Hombre_y_del_Ciudadano&amp;oldid=130284998):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Los hombres nacen y permanecen libres e iguales en derechos. Las distinciones sociales solo pueden fundarse en la utilidad común. La finalidad de toda asociación política es la conservación de los derechos naturales e imprescriptibles del hombre. Esos derechos son la libertad, la propiedad, la seguridad y la resistencia a la opresión. La fuente de toda soberanía reside esencialmente en la nación; ningún individuo, ni ninguna corporación pueden ser revestidos de autoridad alguna que no emane directamente de ella. La libertad consiste en poder hacer todo aquello que no cause perjuicio a los demás. El ejercicio de los derechos naturales de cada hombre, no tiene otros límites que los que garantizan a los demás miembros de la sociedad el disfrute de los mismos derechos. Estos límites solo pueden ser determinados por la ley. La ley solo puede prohibir las acciones que son perjudiciales a la sociedad. Lo que no está prohibido por la ley no puede ser impedido. Nadie puede verse obligado a aquello que la ley no ordena. La ley es expresión de la voluntad de la comunidad. Todos los ciudadanos tienen derecho a colaborar en su formación, sea personalmente, sea por medio de sus representantes. Debe ser igual para todos, sea para proteger o para castigar. Siendo todos los ciudadanos iguales ante ella, todos son igualmente elegibles para todos los honores, colocaciones y empleos, conforme a sus distintas capacidades, sin ninguna otra distinción que la creada por sus virtudes y conocimientos. Ningún hombre puede ser acusado, arrestado y mantenido en confinamiento, excepto en los casos determinados por la ley, y de acuerdo con las formas por esta prescritas. Todo aquel que promueva, solicite, ejecute o haga que sean ejecutadas órdenes arbitrarias, debe ser castigado, y todo ciudadano requerido o aprendido por virtud de la ley debe obedecer inmediatamente, y se hace culpable si ofrece resistencia. La ley no debe imponer otras penas que aquellas que son estrictas y evidentemente necesarias; y nadie puede ser castigado sino en virtud de una ley promulgada con anterioridad a la ofensa y legalmente aplicada. Todo hombre es considerado inocente hasta que ha sido declarado convicto. Si se estima que su arresto es indispensable, cualquier rigor mayor del indispensable para asegurar su persona ha de ser severamente reprimido por la ley. Ningún hombre debe ser molestado por razón de sus opiniones, ni aún por sus ideas religiosas, siempre que al manifestarlas no se causen trastornos del orden público establecido por la ley.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. (Spelling change) Replace *ce*, *ci* with *the*, *thi* (as they are pronounced): *nacen* $\rightarrow$ *nathen*, *sociales* $\rightarrow$ *sothiales* etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. (Spelling change) The acute accent indicates the position of the dynamic stress when it falls in a place other than where it's expected:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   * If the acute is on the last syllable before an *n* or an *s*, delete the acute and double the consonant: *ningún* $\rightarrow$ *ningunn*, *demás* $\rightarrow$ *demass*, *razón* $\rightarrow$ *razonn*. (It's not deleterious, since Spanish cannot have double consonants in that position.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. (Spelling change) Replace *ñ* with *ny* and *ll* with *ly*. (It could have been the chosen spelling, but wasn't.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. (Spelling change) Replace *qu* with *k* (or *c*, since by now we no longer have any possibilit of confusion); *que* $\rightarrow$ *ce*, *aquellas* $\rightarrow$ *acelyas* etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. (Spelling change) Replace all *i*s and *u*s with *y* and *w* when they represent semivowels (also called glides, the less sonorous parts of diphthongs): *igual* $\rightarrow$ *igwal*, *cualquier* $\rightarrow$ *cwalcyer*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. (Spelling change) Delete initial and intervocalic *h*. (It is silent anyway.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. (Spelling change) Replace *ge*, *gi* with *hhe*, *hhi*, and then *j* with *h*:&#xD;&#xA;*ejecutadas* $\rightarrow$ *ehecutadas*, *ejercicio* $\rightarrow$ *eherthithyo* etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point we have regular Spanish with a somewhat novel, but yet still consistent, spelling. Let's go and apply some natural sound changes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. Replace endings in *-ad*, *-ades* with *-à*, *-ass*. (Italian did it, for the singular; in the plural, Italian keeps *-à* unchanged.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. Delete final *-o*; in order to preserve the position of the dynamic stress, you must of course double the preceding consonant, as required by rule 2. (Romanian did it; we have *lup* for Spanish *lobo*, *tot* for Spanish *todo* etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   * If the word ends in *-wo*, replace with *-u*.&#xD;&#xA;   * If the word ends in *-yo* (at this stage of the modifications), replace the *-o* with *-u*.&#xD;&#xA;   * If the final *-o* is the only vowel in the word, replace with *-u*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. Replace final *-i* with *iy*, final *-e* with *i*, and final *-a* with *e*. (Old French did the last one.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;11. Now do the plurals: replace final *-os* with *-uy*. (Romanian went even further, but let's keep it Spanish-y.) Replace final *-es* with *iy*. Replace final *-as* with *ey*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;12. (Slight, if any sound change.) Consistently replace *vl* and *vr* with *br* and *bl*, and elsewhere consistently replace *b* with *v*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;13. Finally, replace clusters of two occlusives (also known as stops) with the second one doubled, as Italian did.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point we have:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Luy ombriy nathen yiy permanethen libriy i igwaliy en derechuy.

By contrast, /q/ is _uvular_; that is, it is produced with the tongue touching the uvula. (Another way to think about it: /q/ is produced towards the back of the mouth compared to /k/.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to summarise: /q/ and /k/ are very similar sounds, except /q/ is slightly backer than /k/.

Biology is _sona jan_ and Mathematics is _sona nanpa_.

Almost all of these are polysemantic, there's nothing like synonyms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; grammar must be fully regular&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Grammar is not fully regular, but that's only because of the fact that toki pona has a few words. However, there are _not_ that many exceptions, as in any language like English or Spanish.

Some accelerate language change, some slow it down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Accelerating**: Language is used to create identity. The first, most important and biggest tribe are the ship's crew and passengers (if such a distinction is made). They will start to set themselves apart through names for themselves versus the planet dwellers.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Within the ship, different sub-tribes like engineers, gardeners, educators etc. will create respectively continue to develop their own slang in order to set themselves apart from other groups. The urge to set themselves apart is greater because the ship packs many people in a comparatively small space, creating a need to draw virtual borders. &#xD;&#xA; - **Accelerating**: Groups with lots of spare time (which I suppose our space travelers will have) generally devote some of it to developing sophisticated tastes, fads and fashions, thus creating in-groups; their language evolution is interacting with these identity functions. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to speak &quot;their slang&quot; (and wear their hair cut, and posture ...) are marked as &quot;not belonging to them&quot;. To a degree this happens in every generation of teenagers. But we can see that also on a larger scale in the development of the aristocratic French, or the fast-paced development of the politically correct speech in the United States.&#xD;&#xA; - **Slowing down**: There will be constant communication between all individuals of the ship through some kind of publications and messaging as well as personal conversation, given the necessary physical proximity and the need to cooperate during the mission (no group will be able to isolate themselves). This will ensure that there will continue to be a single *lingua franca*, fads and fashions not withstanding. Some people may learn and teach other languages for scientific, identity, hobby and nostalgic reasons, but they all will be competent in the main language. An important driver of the evolution of this language will be the slang of the youngsters, as always.&#xD;&#xA; - **Slowing down**: The generation ship will probably communicate via radio with the planet they came from; but most communication will be internal, partly because after a while communication with the home planet will not be real-time any more. The generation ship will form an isolated, small community. Such communities, like the Amish in America or the German settlers in Romania, are known to preserve customs and language longer than the bigger communities thy split off of. We can assume that the ship receives entertainment from the home planet, like music, movies and written prose. Thus they will keep in touch with the language on the home planet; whether that ongoing contact is sufficient to keep the language on board from running its own course I don't know.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Even in English which has a somewhat strict word order (even though you can be quite flexible with it if you want), like I demonstrated above, you **don't** have specific endings on words, and you don't have a super strict 100%-of-the-time word order. _(English has some word endings like `-ing` and `-ly` and such, but these are not even consistent 100% of the time)_&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, I am looking across a few languages, and nouns, verbs, and adjectives in each language might be allowed to **all** _start_ or _end_ with vowels or consonants, and might all have endings which are the same.

You have these words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bully. _(Noun, &quot;A mean sort of person&quot;, ends in `-ly`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Clearly. _(Adjective, ends in `-ly`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sully. _(Verb, &quot;to make dirty&quot;, ends in `-ly`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some rules are more strict, like I can't seem to find any adjectives that end in `-ed`, which is used for past-tense or state sort of verbs, `created`, `acted`, `iced`, etc. But this `-ly` ending can go on any type of word. Same with other endings, like `-ing`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bring. _(Infinitive verb, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Clearing. _(present participle verb, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ring. _(Noun, or verb, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Amusing. _(Adjective, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All kinds of other examples of prefixes and suffixes where they are used across nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc..

Can I pick any &quot;base&quot; word and attach _any_ ending on any part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, particle)? And will the language still work? _How can I tell if it will work and not be confusing_? Without having the conlang _completed_ and working, (while it is being developed), as I try to generate example sentences, it seems like it would lead to pure confusing not having more rigid patterns in the words to distinguish nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How should I be thinking about this to make some progress? How should I conceptualize the differences between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles, so I can generate words that flow together into a sentence but aren't confusing?

I get that **word order** is a factor, as well as the nebulous idea of **context**. But word order seems so flexible, I don't see what I need to do when creating a conlang in terms of how to structure nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles, to make sure you can understand the sentence. What are the key techniques or procedures to follow in designing this? So you can clearly tell what is a noun, verb, adjective, or particle. How do we even do this in regular natural languages? I don't understand. And I don't know how to search for this in Google to learn more about how we resolve the sentences meaning without having clear and unique patterns that clearly separate nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles from each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of examples on why it's confusing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I see the **big black oak tree**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The `tree` is the noun, and `big black oak` are modifiers on the noun sort of thing. So you could say they are adjectives or &quot;features&quot; of the tree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I see **the big**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But here `big` is the noun, like `The Big`, as in something big, in which you are invoking a lot of context in your listeners mind. Or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I see **the black**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here black is the noun, like all you see is darkness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In these sentences, there is no change in the structure of the words, but they take on different roles in the sentences. That is, `big` can be an adjective or noun (or even a verb!) without adding a specific prefix or suffix to that base.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't come up with a science on why we are able to properly interpret these sentences. In my conlang, I am thinking that, in order to make it easier to interpret, I would have special endings on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles. So you would have the equivalent of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I see-ami the big-azi black-azi oak-azi tree-ali&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this sort of system, every verb would end in `-ami`, every adjective with `-azi`, and every noun with `-ali`. I keep on thinking I **need** such a system in order to make the sentences comprehensible. I would use this structure _in addition_ to a **strict word order** to make it so sentences are comprehensible. So what I keep thinking I **need**, in summary, is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Specific endings** on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles, to distinguish them easily.&#xD;&#xA;2. **Strict word order** in sentences, so you can easily tell what is in the adjective place, in the noun place, in the verb place, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the problem is, _this is not how natural languages work_! Even in English which has a somewhat strict word order (even though you can be quite flexible with it if you want), like I demonstrated above, you **don't** have specific endings on words, and you don't have a super strict 100%-of-the-time word order. _(English has some word endings like `-ing` and `-ly` and such, but these are not even consistent 100% of the time)_&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, I am looking across a few languages, and nouns, verbs, and adjectives in each language might be allowed to **all** _start_ or _end_ with vowels or consonants, and might all have endings which are the same. That is, there isn't even a pattern which clearly separates nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles into separate categories based on the word's morphology! For example, let's use English. You have these words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bully. _(Noun, &quot;A mean sort of person&quot;, ends in `-ly`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Clearly. _(Adjective, ends in `-ly`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sully. _(Verb, &quot;to make dirty&quot;, ends in `-ly`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some rules are more strict, like I can't seem to find any adjectives that end in `-ed`, which is used for past-tense or state sort of verbs, `created`, `acted`, `iced`, etc. But this `-ly` ending can go on any type of word. Same with other endings, like `-ing`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bring. _(Infinitive verb, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Clearing. _(present participle verb, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ring. _(Noun, or verb, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Amusing. _(Adjective, ends in `-ing`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All kinds of other examples exist (of prefixes and suffixes) where they are used across nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.. In many other languages too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other words, which I'm using in English but might come from other languages, are nouns which have all sorts of endings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Man. _(Noun, ends in consonant `n`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Joy. _(Noun, ends in consonant `y`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Dao. _(Noun, &quot;the Way&quot;, ends in vowel `o`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Glee. _(Noun, ends in vowel `e`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Rabbi. _(Noun, ends in vowel `i`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then same for verbs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Assign. _(Verb, ends in consonant `n`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Play. _(Verb, ends in consonant `y`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Echo. _(Verb, ends in vowel `o`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Free. _(Verb, ends in vowel `e`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ski. _(Verb, ends in vowel `i`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And same for adjectives:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Green. _(Adjective, ends in consonant `n`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Happy. _(Adjective, ends in consonant `y`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Latino. _(Adjective, ends in vowel `o`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Eerie. _(Adjective, ends in vowel `e`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Pakistani. _(Adjective, ends in vowel `i`)_&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So this basically shows, at least for English, there is no relation between the word ending and whether it is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.. _So it makes me think in my conlang, I don't need to add the constraint of having nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles have different endings to make them distinguishable_. Somehow we are able to tell the difference in sense of these words based on some other nebulous thing, like context or meaning/semantics during the flow of speech.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question is, how do I use these facts when constructing a conlang? Can I pick any &quot;base&quot; word and attach _any_ ending on any part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, particle)? And will the language still work? _How can I tell if it will work and not be confusing_? What do I do when developing the conlang to test if it is confusing or not how I have structured words?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without having the conlang _completed_ and working, (while it is being developed), as I try to generate example sentences, it seems like it would lead to pure confusion not having more rigid patterns in the words to distinguish nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How should I be thinking about this to make some progress?

What this means is that in general, there is no way to find the part of speech of a word knowing only the word itself. You have to memorise it separately for each word.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good way of seeing this is to observe that two languages may assign different parts of speech to exactly the same word when it is borrowed from one language to another. For instance, _boil_ is a verb in English. But when it was loaned into the Papuan language Komnzo, it was borrowed as a member of the Komnzo class of ‘property nouns’ ([Döhler 2018](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/212)). There is nothing inherently ‘nouny’ or ‘verby’ about the form or function of this word; you simply have to memorise that _boil_ is a verb in English and a property noun in Komnzo. And this can even happen within a language: the English word _release_, for instance, is both a noun and a verb.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if word classes cannot be reliably distinguished based on their form or their semantics¹, then what is the difference between different parts of speech? The answer is simple: parts of speech specify _the environments in which words can be used_. For instance, consider this sentence:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I saw the _____.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This sentence has a gap in it. You can make a grammatical sentence by filling this gap with nouns: _I saw the **dog**_, _I saw the **cat**_, _I saw the **chair**_, _I saw the **release**_, _I saw the **idea**_. (Note that, even though the last example doesn’t really make sense, it still counts as it is a grammatical sentence.) On the other hand, if you try this with a non-noun, the result is ungrammatical: *_I saw the sit_, *_I saw the eat_, *_I saw the is_. So we can use this example to give a definition of a noun: a word which makes a grammatical sentence when preceeded by _I saw the_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This definition can be made a lot more general though: a noun is simply a word which can follow a determiner. What is a determiner? Well, you _could_ define it as something which can precede a noun, but that would be circular. Instead, simply note that there are a fixed set of 20 or so words which can occur in such a position: _a_, _the_, _one_, _some_, _much_, _many_ and the like. A determiner is then just one of these words. Determiners are thus a ‘closed class’: a part of speech which has a fixed number of words, and into which no more words can be added. Note that each language has a slightly different set of closed classes, though there are similarities: articles, numbers, adpositions and adjectives, for instance, are often closed. (Komnzo unusually has _verbs_ as a closed class, explaining why my example of _boil_ above was loaned as a noun rather than a verb.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you can go further. English nouns can be used after a determiner — but there are several other environments in which nouns can occur. They can take the plural marker _-s_: _dogs_, _cats_, _chairs_, _releases_, _ideas_. They can also modify another noun: _dog leash_, _cat collar_, _chair wood_, _release method_, _idea food_. (The last few examples are a bit contrived, but illustrate the point well enough). So, you can use this to define nouns in English: English nouns are that word class which can be used after a determiner, take a plural marker, and modify another noun. Or, to put it another way, if you find a word which can occur in all these places — why then, that word must be a noun!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to answer your question ‘How should I conceptualize the differences between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles?’: conceptualize it in terms of morphosyntactic environments (the fancy name for what I’ve been talking about). A word class is distinguished by the environments it can occur in: if you know what word class a word occurs in, then you know in which environments you can use in, and _vice versa_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will use one final example to illustrate the point. Consider the well-known example sentence:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The gostak distims the doshes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From this sentence, I can tell that _gostak_ and _dosh_ are nouns, while _distim_ is a verb — even though I may never have seen these words before. Why? Just look at the environments:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- _Gostak_ occurs in the environment ‘the ____’. Thus we know it is a noun.&#xD;&#xA;- _Dosh_ occurs in the environment ‘the ____’, and also takes the suffix _-s_. Thus it must be a noun.&#xD;&#xA;- For _distim_, we can look at the position of the word in the sentence. It occurs between two noun phrases; this is obviously sufficient to make up a complete sentence. Any word with this property in English must be a verb.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Further reading: [François’s analysis of Hiw word classes](http://alex.francois.online.fr/data/AlexFrancois_2017_Economy-word-classes_St-in-Lg_print.pdf) is a particularly illuminating example of these ideas. I highly recommend reading through this paper for a detailed discussion of how word classes can be defined with reference to syntactic environments.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;________&#xD;&#xA;¹ Well, this is a slight lie. There are clearly semantic distinctions between word classes such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Also, I vaguely remember that there are some languages in which some parts of speech _do_ have phonological correlates, though I can’t remember their names. My point is that neither of these are particularly reliable ways to determine parts of speech, which should ideally be defined using only morphosyntactic criteria." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Over time, as has happened in real languages, this was simplified to a simpler singular/plural system except in personal pronouns, which retained the original distinctions. In other words, the language would distinguish only between &quot;woman&quot; (one woman) and &quot;women&quot; (more than one woman), but when you used a pronoun, you'd have &quot;she&quot; (one woman), &quot;she2&quot; (two women&quot;), &quot;she+&quot; (a few women), and &quot;she++&quot; (many women).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your conversations would thus look like the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;That woman came out of the store. She is carrying a bag.&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Those women came out of the store. She2 are carrying bags.&quot; (Two women came out)&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Those women came out of the store.

I'm not just restricting it the way I've done, but the general situation where the grammar of the language has simplified down the grammatical number, perhaps even to not having a singular/plural distinction at all, except for retaining a more elaborate grammatical number system in one single common grammatical element."

For example ز and ژ could both be fricatives but one voiced &amp; one unvoiced with the number of i'jām dots indicating voiced &amp; unvoiced. As an example 1 dot (خ) could be unvoiced, &amp; 2 dots (ت) could be voiced , 3 dots (ش/چ) could be digraphs(?) like sh/ch/th etc;. Their placement above or below could even mean something (پ/ث)? vowels could be diacritics like how Arabic harakat are used. I'm not really talking about *adapting* Arabic itself to write english. Plenty of those have been done, some good, some bad. I'm talking about a script *inspired* by Arabic, but that is really suited to write English because it is designed for English. Dots &amp; vowels could even be omitted to further speed up writing if the dots/vowels could easily be inferred from context as in ([Rasm][2]). To use an example that can be typed: 'تُن' could be 'dot', but without diacritics could be 'date' depending on context &amp; with i'jām reversed it could be represent 't-d'.

Throat singing might be a possibility, so we could look at the environment surrounding that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;The popularity of throat singing among Tuvans seems to have arisen as a result of geographic location and culture. The open landscape of Tuva allows for the sounds to carry a great distance.

I'm not very familiar with geography) and perhaps combined with animist beliefs might explain the development of a polyphonic language, which would include not only specially spoken vowels, but also perhaps the use of false vocal folds and other throat singing techniques (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone_singing).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, you mention the possibility of such a language being doubly tonal. In that regard, a humid area might be conducive to a tonal language, though the Tuvan language is considered a pitch accent language rather than tonal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvan_language). Alternatively, tone can arise from contact with other tonal languages." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Chinese and Japanese didn't used to have punctuation, nor apparently did Latin and Ancient Greek. So I'd say that's the first thing to consider: your proto-script needn't have had any punctuation at all. But over time, scribes found that it was a pain in the backside to write long continuous strings and just figure out by context where sentences end and begin. How they choose to delimit those sentences* is up to them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Maybe writers split up sentences using a vertical bar or a slash, or a middle dot like the interpunct used in Japanese and Chinese, or some other kooky character. Maybe sentences are grouped using something similar to brackets at the start and end. Or maybe ancient authors actually drew a circle or line around each sentence to delimit it from the next (it never had to be practical!) Future authors realised that, if all they wanted to do was tell where one sentence ended and another began, all they had to do is draw a circle around every *other* sentence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (So you might have a paragraph like this.) Where every other sentence is uncircled. (And the next sentence is circled again.) Imagine that these brackets are circles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Punctuation within sentences is, again, up to you. It's perfectly possible that your script's writers never decided that they needed to split up clauses using commas, separate lists using colons, or mark speech using quotation marks etc. Maybe they mark speech separately with an underline, or a dotted line. Or maybe they write using different coloured inks depending on type of sentence being written.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Maybe, instead of little marks, your proto-script could have fully-fledged characters without any spoken value, but which are used to delimit clauses in the same way as commas are. Of course, over time these might have reduced and transformed into a small, easy to write character - in much the same way that Simplified Chinese emerged over time because some scholars somewhere were too lazy to write out 麗 every time, and went with 丽 instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point is: free yourself from **all** constraints about how your writing should be written. Start with a blank canvas if you like, and add in features as you see fit. Think about your proto-script and how the first scribes might have written things down - then think about how later writers would have abbreviated those forms and made them shorter, simpler and easier. As Artifexian says: Iterate, Iterate, Iterate. Write down random scribbles and see how they pair with your script.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are just a few random ideas. I hope some of them help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;\* I don't know how your language works, but you might not even need to separate sentences. Maybe just clauses, paragraphs, or &quot;logical ideas&quot;.

If the number of possible sounds per syllable is limited, then limiting syllables is going to be one of the main challenges. Some approaches to limit syllables are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Assign a separate **meaning to every possible syllable** that could be pronounced. It's best if the meanings are as distant as possible from each other.&#xD;&#xA;- **Avoid synonyms**, similar to the previous point, where multiple different sounds map to the same meaning.&#xD;&#xA;- Allow for things like optional **contractions**, that shorten the spelling or pronunciation.&#xD;&#xA;- Use **strict word order** rules, as opposed to grammatical particles/prefixes/suffixes, when possible. If a subject is always at the beginning of a sentence, it won't need to be marked as a subject, for example.&#xD;&#xA;- When deriving new words by combining existing ones, use very **small fragments of root words** as opposed to the whole thing. For example, instead of `sand + castle --&gt; sandcastle`, do `sand + castle --&gt; sandle/sastle`.&#xD;&#xA;- In addition to assigning meaning to syllables, an extreme approach would be to go down to the letter level, approximate **meanings for each letter**. This can help in the compound word scenario with picking important letters out of a root as opposed to the whole word." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For a comparison that shows how a word having multiple purposes could denote verblessness, see how [Salishan Languages][2] can be considered nounless:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Words with noun-like meanings are automatically equivalent to [be + NOUN] when used predicatively, such as Lushootseed sbiaw which means '(is a) coyote'. Words with more verb-like meanings, when used as arguments, are equivalent to [one that VERBs] or [VERB+er]. For example, Lushootseed ʔux̌ʷ means '(one that) goes'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In natural languages, where words evolve in meaning over time, you can see meanings change over time. See how the words Be, Is and Am come about:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Old English bēon, an irregular and defective verb, whose full conjugation derives from several originally distinct verbs. The forms am and is are from an Indo-European root shared by Latin sum and est . The forms was and were are from an Indo-European root meaning ‘remain’. The forms be and been are from an Indo-European root shared by Latin fui ‘I was’, fio ‘I become’, and Greek phuein ‘bring forth, cause to grow’. The origin of are is uncertain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;\- Google.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be possible to make a language where your verb is a primarily a noun/adjective/adposition but can be considered a verb only secondarily, as it's meaning changes over the imaginary history of the language. Maybe the word LA primarily means SEAT or GROUND (specifically a noun, not another verb). But when it's used with another word, it's meaning changes from the noun to a verb-like sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This way you could have a verbless language, where it's verb-like words evolved out of non-verbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But Kēlen has no such evolution of relationals, so they can serve no other purpose than to be one for one verb replacements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseless_language&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salishan_languages#Nounlessness" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It has the advantage to be &quot;immediately&quot; readable by users of the Slavic family. One may compare this language with **Interlingua** for Romance languages. But Slavic languages seem to be even more similar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Concrete **Esperanto** I consider a more powerful language, but with its **claim on more heterogeneous language origins**, it has coincidental choices (Tuesday = _mardo_, month = _monato_), and a hard phonetical spelling (peace = _paco_ [pátsoh]).&#xD;&#xA;Also Esperanto has its own accented letters for phoneticism: _ĉĝĥĵŝŭ_ (she = _ŝi_).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And **Slovio** is a more acceptable, familiar language, though non-Slavic loan words risk getting purged.

But that is less important (than with Esperanto). As Slavic languages can have their difficult parts, which in Slovio are simplified, I would be interested how Slovio would compare to **Basic English**, an English without unneeded, superfluous terms, and inflections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***The Question***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Slovio][1] is based on the ideas of Esperanto. The alphabet for instance, including the x-system. Suffixes, prefixes.

Not sure whether faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Serbian and a Bulgarian will be able to communicate, even without Slovio. Slovio as common _lingua franca_? Who knows.

The first language, Vietrian, splits in two to create Old Viereian and New Vietrian. The basic difference is: &quot;old&quot; is used for spells making, and &quot;new&quot; is used for communication, this also vague since it is a five-page long difference.

The caveat is that I would expect digit grouping to match up with however wide this ends up betting before looping (so, for example, if you go with one million being the largest power of ten you have a special name for, I would expect the digit grouping in written form to separate digits into groups of 10)."

Basic English seems to get by with 2000 words or so.&#xD;&#xA; - [Toki Pona][2], on the other hand, a philosophical language rather than an international auxiliary language or an artistic language, makes do with about 120 root words. In the article, it's noted that speakers have to resort to combining these root words in order to get their meaning across when they wish to communicate anything that isn't, strictly speaking, minimalist in nature.&#xD;&#xA; - [Esperanto][3] has somewhere between 2500 and 5000 basic roots, but again, combining roots allows for greater understandability.&#xD;&#xA; - At the other end of the spectrum, [English][4] probably exceeds a million words.

And lastly, I'd argue that even a million words is not nearly enough! Even with a million words, English speakers make use of affixes, compounding, abbreviation and we're sprathingly good at just plain making up words on top of everything else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_vocabulary&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://www.dictionary.com/e/how-many-words-in-english/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

But both Esperanto and English have one word, wheras toki pona has three. So the question of the number of words is not really all that meaningful, as it depends on the structure of your language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The real question is how many morphemes you need, but even then it's difficult. In toki pona you can combine morphemes to form bigger elements, and each morpheme arguably has a whole range of meanings; from the context you choose the one that is most likely. The word _lili_ means little, small, young, etc. so you cannot know whether _jan lili_ is a young person or a small one. You will typically know from context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So when thinking about vocabulary size there are several aspects to consider:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Language structure: do you have self-standing morphemes that are combined to phrases (like toki pona), morphemes that are stuck together in compound words (like Esperanto), or single morphemes that express multiple meanings at once (like English _king_: 'ruler' and 'male' vs _queen_: 'ruler' and 'female'). If &amp;mdash; like Esperanto &amp;mdash; you stick to one basic meaning component per morpheme, then the gender of the ruler would have to be expressed in a different morpheme (or it could be omitted altogether). The same also applies to verbs and tenses, pronouns, etc.&#xD;&#xA;2. Specificity: How accurate do you want your language to be? If you want to be able to express exact meanings, then you need different morphemes. In English there are many words such as _Earl_, _Duke_, _Count_, _Margrave_, etc. which in toki pona would just be _jan lawa_ ('leader'). Toki pona is good for epics, where such distinctions are not relevant, but if you want to write a detailed history of the Norman conquest, then maybe choose a different language.&#xD;&#xA;3. Target domain: It also makes a difference what you want to use your language for. If it is an intergalactic _[lingua franca][2]_ to be used for trading, then you'd need to be specific about prices and descriptions of objects, but not so much about family relationships. Klingon famously has a vocabulary dominated by words related to fighting and killing, so it might be hard to write a love poem in it (though not impossible). A general purpose language needs to be able to express a wider range of meanings than a domain-specific one.&#xD;&#xA;4. Overall complexity of your language: How many cases do you have? How many numbers? Grammatical genders? Any such feature needs to be expressed in some way, which could result in more words. If you have singular/dual/plural, you might need three pronouns _I_, _us-two_, and _us-more-than-two_. But you could choose not to have that at all and simply use _us-any-number-from-one-to-many_. Hawai'an has a different set of pronouns to distinguish between _us all, including you_ and _us all, but not you_. If you have a politeness system based on relative ages, then you might want to distinguish between _you-who-is-younger-then-me_ and a more polite _you-who-is-older-than-me_&#xD;&#xA;5. Aesthetics: you can make do with one word for _move-from-A-to-B_. And one word for _ingest_. But any story you write will quickly become very boring, as you will use the same word over and over again. So you want [synonyms][3] to introduce some variation (see the remarks about Klingon above). The more synonyms you have, the more words. They're not strictly necessary, but make your language more pleasant to use. In AI, this is actually used to make it easier for computers to handle events: you have a small set of [semantic primitives][4] for the basic events (movement, transfer of objects, etc). But you wouldn't want to read such representations for fun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To summarise: The right number of words for a conlang is how many you need for it to work, given the purpose and structure of the language. It is a bit of an irrelevant question, really, because you won't know that you have enough words until you're happy that your language is usable. And even then, new words are likely to develop over time. In my view, number of words is not a useful metric when developing a language, unless you want to use it as a constraint (as in toki pona).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_dependency_theory" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Let me expand a bit below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To answer your question in brief**: *no*, your language does not need a Dative, but *yes*, your language needs a device (or &quot;construction&quot; in Construction Grammar terms) to express the third argument (also called the &quot;indirect object&quot;) of verbs that take on three arguments (subject, object, indirect object).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, whether you have separate devices (constructions, or in your case &quot;cases&quot;, no pun intended) for semantically different indirect objects or not, that is up to you. Since you already have a Benefactive case that could express an indirect object (whether that is semantically a recipient or a beneficiary or else), then you can use that to express an indirect object that is a simple recipient. So, note that **there can be a mismatch between syntactic arguments and semantic arguments** (for example indirect object vs. recipient, benefactor, etc). Moreover, depending on what linguistic framework you assume, things can be slightly different. Here I am adhering to some form of (Radical) Construction Grammar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, since you have a Benefactive case and a Lative case you could use the former in sentences like &quot;I gave the book *to the man*&quot; and &quot;I opened the door *for the woman*&quot; and the Lative case for &quot;I went *to the market*&quot; and &quot;I am throwing a stone *at you*&quot;. But again, that is really up to you, as also hinted at in other answers/comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drafts of the first two chapters of Croft's *Morphosyntax: constructions of the world's languages* expand on this.

I think this is a similar concept to how languages can change how many things you can notice, [even colors][2] can be hard to distinguish if you don't have a word for it.

If you have additional structures, you'll have additional places of articulation, and if you're missing some structures you'll have fewer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now methods of articulation. There are four main articulators involved in speech, each of which allows for the production of sounds in a different set of places of articulation. These are the lips, the tongue, the pharynx, &amp; the glottis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each articulator can produce a variety of gestures:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Complete closure: this gives stops, taps, and trills&#xD;&#xA; - Close restriction: this gives fricatives&#xD;&#xA; - Open restriction: this gives approximants and vowels&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tongue, and to a lesser extent the lips are very flexible and can contact multiple places of articulation. In humans, the lips can contact the other lip, or the teeth, whilst the tongue can contact anything from the lips to the uvula. If your elves have especially short lips, or lack the overbite common in humans today, they might find labiodontals difficult and lack them, and if they have short tongues, they are unlikely to have linguolabials, or even dentals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, these articulators are able to form a variety of shapes and can use different parts of themselves to make the articulation. This gives the difference between retroflex and alveolar consonants (are you contacting with the top of the tongue, the tip, or even the bit just below the tip), between sibilants &amp; non-sibilants (is the tongue flat or grooved), and between laterals and non-laterals (is the restriction made with the edges of the tongue or the centre). In natural languages, these shape contrasts are only observed with the tongue as articulator, but if your elves have especially bendy lips, they might be able to produce analogous contrasts with their lips.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The glottis and pharynx are fairly restricted due to their very nature, both only being able to act in their respective place of articulation, but you do have some freedom here in terms of what articulations they can actually produce. Human glottises can produce stops or fricatives, but the pharynx cannot produce stops. Perhaps your elves are able to fully close their pharynx (not only would this allow for pharyngeal stops, it would also allow for a new secondary articulation, intermediate between clicks, which use a velar closure, and ejectives, which use a glottal closure).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In humans, because our jaws are hinged at the back, fully open restriction is only really possible from the soft palate forwards. This is why the distinction between approximants and fricatives starts getting fuzzy around the uvula and back, the open restriction &amp; close restriction are just too nearby for the clumsy back of the tongue, or the pharynx, or glottis to reliably distinguish them (likewise, vowels are articulated exclusively in the space between the alveolar ridge and soft palate). If your elves have mouths that swing open in such a way that the back is as open as the front, they might be able to reliably distinguish uvula fricatives from approximants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to these main articulators, there are a couple of other things to consider. These are the vocal chords and the nasal cavity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Vocal chords give you the ability to distinguish voicing. Humans have tremendous control over our vocal chords allowing for languages that distinguish many different phonations (modal voicing, voiceless, creaky, breathy, etc), as well precise differences in voice onset time (voiced, tenuis, aspirated). If your elves have even finer control they may be able to distinguish even more levels, and if they have weaker control, they may distinguish fewer, or none at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The nasal cavity allows for nasal sounds. Gesturally, nasals aren't a separate method of articulation, but a secondary articulation on top of a voiced stop (the same secondary articulation that would go on a nasalised vowel, approximant, or fricative). In nasalised sounds, the very back of the soft palate (around the uvular) lowers, allowing air to enter it at the same time as it enters the mouth, this adds an additional resonating chamber giving an extra overtone visible in a waveform. Because the back of the soft palate has to lower to produce them, nasals are most easily produced forward in the mouth, are difficult on the soft palate, and impossible further back than the uvula. If your elves' nasal cavity connects further forwards than humans, they might find velar or even palatal nasals difficult, if it connects further back, they might find uvular nasals easy, and have an additional series of pharyngeal nasals even further back that they can produce but find difficult.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any other changes to the vocal tract will affect the timbre of the sounds produced, but not what the sounds actually are at a gestural level (or how they would likely be perceived by a human with some exposure to the language). Many of the changes discussed above (especially adding or removing structures from the vocal tract) will also affect the timbre. As it is, it sounds like all the differences between your elf vocal tract and a human one are of this type." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In a minimal–augmented system, each person comes in two pronominal forms: *minimal*, which is singlar for 1, 2 and 3, but dual for 1+2; and *augmented*, which is more than minimal. Slotting your pronominal table into this system gives the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;| Minimal | Augmented |&#xD;&#xA;| - | - |&#xD;&#xA;| 1 | 1+3+3+… |&#xD;&#xA;| 1+2 | 1+2+3+… |&#xD;&#xA;| 2 | 2+2+… |&#xD;&#xA;| 3 | 3+3+… |&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But now that I look at this table, I notice something odd. See, the augmented form of 3 is many 3s, and the augmented form of 2 is many 2s. But the augmented form of 1 refers to many 3s! This is odd, especially considering that a first person plural pronoun is usually 1+1+… — no need to drag random third persons into it. Similarly, your augmented 1+2 pronoun should be many first and second persons, without third persons. Thus, your 1+2+2+… form should be the *augmented 1+2* pronoun:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;| Minimal | Augmented |&#xD;&#xA;| - | - |&#xD;&#xA;| 1 | 1+1+… |&#xD;&#xA;| 1+2 | 1+2+1+2+… |&#xD;&#xA;| 2 | 2+2+… |&#xD;&#xA;| 3 | 3+3+… |&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or, if you prefer, you can shoehorn it into a more ‘traditional’ form and call it a first person inclusive plural:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![table of minimal/augmented pronouns][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dnXLc.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For a start, some languages have ‘verbal classifiers’ (Aikhenvald 2000). These are a set of incorporated nouns or dedicated affixes which agree with a verbal argument, most commonly the S/O argument. Such a system will certainly be mostly or entirely orthogonal to the gender system, so is useful for further disambiguation. Even 5 or so verbal classifiers — a very small number — is enough to give a reasonable number of class/classifier combinations: (I denote the noun classes in uppercase and verbal classifiers in lowercase)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;1sg-ERG cat(I,i)-ABS mouse(II,i)-ABS i-see-PRS-I NEG-i-see-PRS-II&#xD;&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the way, I see no reason why the  verb should agree only with the absolutive argument in noun class (cf Bantu), so let’s add some polypersonal agreement for further disambiguation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;1sg-ERG cat(I,i)-ABS mouse(II,i)-ABS i-see-PRS-I-1sg NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xD;&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let’s go further. In some languages, alignment is lexically determined by the verb used. Though this usually occurs with agreement affixes, one can imagine a system where there are several possibilities for case-marking of intransitive and transitive verbs, with the verb retaining its transitivity. This adds extra information when two verbs are juxtaposed with their arguments interleaved. In this case, it seems reasonable for a verb like ‘see’ to take absolutive–dative marking (or absolutive–accusative, or nominative–accusative, if you like):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;1sg-ABS cat(I,i)-DAT mouse(II,i)-DAT i-see-PRS-I-1sg NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xD;&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let’s go further. It is common for converbal constructions to specify whether the verb is same-subject or different-subject with respect to the main verb, or following clause in the case of clause chaining. Of course, the converbal affix only attaches to the verb itself. However, the Australian language Kayardild has a rather odd construction in which an oblique case is suffixed to nearly every single word of a different-subject complement clause (Evans 1995). This gives me enough precedent to postulate a system wherein a same-subject or different-subject affix is added to every word of the relevant clause:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;1sg-ABS-SS cat(I,i)-DAT-SS mouse(II,i)-DAT i-see-PRS-I-SS NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xD;&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Incidentally, converbs already allow a certain amount of discontinuity in the main clause: e.g. *the man, being a traitor, was tried by the king*.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let’s go further. Negative concord allows the negative to be marked several different times within the clause (e.g. dialectal *I ain’t got no money*). It is straightforward to state that e.g. the negative prefix must be applied to both the absolutive argument and the verb:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;1sg-ABS-SS cat(I,i)-DAT-SS NEG-mouse(II,i)-DAT i-see-PRS-I-SS NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xD;&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xD;&#xA;```&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these together then give enough leeway to do stuff like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mouse(II,i)-ABS-SS NEG-mouse(II,i)-ABS-DS i-chase-PST-II-I-SS NEG-i-catch-PST-II-I-DS cat(I,i)-ERG-SS, 1sg-ABS-SS rat(II,ii)-DAT-SS cat(I,i)-ABS-DS ii-see-PST-II-SS i-tell-PST-I-1sg-DS, ii-catch-PST-II-I-SS i-get.bored-PST-I rat(II,ii)-ABS-SS cat(I,i)-ERG-SS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *The cat chased a mouse, but didn’t catch it; I saw a rat, and told the cat. The cat caught the rat but got bored.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Warning: I’m a bit unsure as to whether some of the nouns should take SS or DS marking, but it should be fine as is.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Other, more obscure languages won't have that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But they can still be useful in a variety of ways:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* expanding your horizon: learning a new language gets you to think in a different way (see the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis][1]) from your native one. This is one reason toki pona was designed the way it was: the limited vocabulary forces you to shed aspects of meaning that are not essential for what you want to say. Klingon has a very lop-sided vocabulary, which again makes it easy to express some aspects, but hard to reason about others. This applies both to natural languages (through attached cultures) and constructed languages.&#xD;&#xA;* easier language learning: this is especially valid for Esperanto. A conlang is often more regular, so learners can learn about concepts of linguistics without worrying too much about exceptions to myriad rules. There is an actual programme (whose name escapes me) where Esperanto is taught as the first foreign language to school kids. This makes it easier for them to learn subsequent languages and they progress faster (even taking into account the additional time of learning Esperanto)&#xD;&#xA;* in-group communication: if you and your friends share an obscure conlang, you can use it to communicate in secret in public. Or you might find it easier to talk about a shared hobby (eg going to the extreme of jargon use by turning it into a language). Or you could write a secret diary in it.&#xD;&#xA;* more concise expression: in computing you have the concept of DSLs (domain specific languages). You can design a conlang which is suited specifically for a particular purpose (expressing emotions, describing inter-personal relationships, mathematics, etc). Natural languages are general purpose languages, but with a conlang you can hone in on areas that you are interested in, and ignore others. This again relates to linguistic relativity in a way.&#xD;&#xA;* game/recreational use: you can use a conlang as an 'exotic' language for NPC in games to make them more realistic. The player can then pick up the language (or learn it, if it is a more well-known conlang) and communicate with the NPCs. Or you could write songs in a conlang (who understands song lyrics anyway!) Or write poetry.&#xD;&#xA;* ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally found Esperanto easy to learn, and when learning other European languages you notice a cross-over in vocabulary. As I learned other languages before, it didn't really give me a better understanding of languages per se (I'd actually studied linguistics by that time already), but I can imagine that it makes it easier to acquire natural languages.

If you're doing this though, you need to be aware of the stage in the language's development you're borrowing into.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this approach, you could do what Arabic and Hebrew did and borrow Middle Persian pwlʾpt' (pōlāwad), possibly as something like pūlâdu-, and then apply whatever sound changes would be expected to occur since the borrowing (if any).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could also coin a word based on native roots, looking at the etymologies for the missing words in related or nearby languages (this technique was used a lot in the revival of Hebrew).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this approach, your word for steel might be kûnu- (possibly phonemically kônu-, if there was an o phoneme) from the verb kânu &quot;to be firm&quot;, following the same etymology as that of English &quot;steel&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other of your major choices is to look at the word in related languages, and construct what the Akkadian cognate would be, had the word existed at the Proto-Semitic stage (something that certainly would not have been the case here, seeing as Proto-Semitic predates the discovery of steel or most of mathematics by quite some time).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately I can't use &quot;steel&quot; as an example here very well, because most of the nearby Semitic languages borrowed their word from Persian. Instead lets look at &quot;equation&quot;. Here the Arabic word is مُعَادَلَة muʿādala, a verbal noun of a Form III verb. Form III verbs in Arabic (which promote the indirect object of a Form I verb to their direct object) do not have a direct cognate class in Akkadian, but the Gt-stem has the closest semantics in this case. The equivalent construction then might be something like tedāltu-.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I say, which approach you should take depends on your goals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Borrowing from a modern hegemonic language is probably the easiest if you just want to make it usable today, and aren't interested in some alternate history for the language where it survived.&#xD;&#xA; * Borrowing from a formerly hegemonic language on the other hand, is good if you are interested in that alternate history, and intend to apply various sound changes from the historical Akkadian to your present day form.&#xD;&#xA; * Coining the word from native roots also works well if you're not interested in alternate history, but is likely to make it harder for other people to learn. This method has historically been popular only when there is already a community who uses the language (in at least some contexts), rather than those where someone is trying to build the community from the ground up.&#xD;&#xA; * Constructing plausible cognates tends to make the most sense for accidental gaps in the lexicon where a word did presumably exist, in other instances it would be pretty unusual."

Immigration: simply borrow a word from another language, with some phonological changes if necessary to adapt it to the new language. English, as possibly the greatest vocabulary thief in history, does this all the time. Examples are too numerous to mention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Adaptation/Evolution: you take an existing word from a related concept and either use it directly with a new meaning, or modify it a bit to differentiate it from the original word and meaning, or simply have the concept itself change over time. As an example, the word &quot;toilet&quot; made the transition &quot;cloth cover for folded clothes&quot; &gt; &quot;cloth cover for a dressing table&quot; &gt; &quot;things related to dressing&quot; &gt; &quot;washing (ie, thing you do prior to dressing&quot; &gt; &quot;room where you wash&quot; &gt; &quot;room for personal hygiene&quot; &gt; &quot;the ceramic thing you sit on to defecate&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Metaphor: use a word or phrase that has some kind of metaphorical association with what you want to name. As an example, &quot;steel&quot; comes from a Proto-Germanic word meaning something like &quot;to stand fast&quot; (ie, be resilient). A computer mouse comes from the shape and cord resembling a real mouse and its tail, as a more modern example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4.

Hence my answer is not so much about Ido in particular, but conlangs in general.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Esperanto is widely spoken all over the world, and is thus practically useful for communication; less widely used languages either have their own enthusiasts' communities (eg toki pona). Other, more obscure languages won't have that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But they can still be useful in a variety of ways:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* expanding your horizon: learning a new language gets you to think in a different way (see the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis][1]) from your native one. This is one reason toki pona was designed the way it was: the limited vocabulary forces you to shed aspects of meaning that are not essential for what you want to say. Klingon has a very lop-sided vocabulary, which again makes it easy to express some aspects, but hard to reason about others. This applies both to natural languages (through attached cultures) and constructed languages.&#xD;&#xA;* easier language learning: this is especially valid for Esperanto. A conlang is often more regular, so learners can learn about concepts of linguistics without worrying too much about exceptions to myriad rules. There is an actual programme (whose name escapes me) where Esperanto is taught as the first foreign language to school kids. This makes it easier for them to learn subsequent languages and they progress faster (even taking into account the additional time of learning Esperanto)&#xD;&#xA;* in-group communication: if you and your friends share an obscure conlang, you can use it to communicate in secret in public. Or you might find it easier to talk about a shared hobby (eg going to the extreme of jargon use by turning it into a language). Or you could write a secret diary in it.&#xD;&#xA;* more concise expression: in computing you have the concept of DSLs (domain specific languages). You can design a conlang which is suited specifically for a particular purpose (expressing emotions, describing inter-personal relationships, mathematics, etc). Natural languages are general purpose languages, but with a conlang you can hone in on areas that you are interested in, and ignore others. This again relates to linguistic relativity in a way.&#xD;&#xA;* game/recreational use: you can use a conlang as an 'exotic' language for NPC in games to make them more realistic. The player can then pick up the language (or learn it, if it is a more well-known conlang) and communicate with the NPCs. Or you could write songs in a conlang (who understands song lyrics anyway!) Or write poetry.&#xD;&#xA;* ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally found Esperanto easy to learn, and when learning other European languages you notice a cross-over in vocabulary. As I learned other languages before, it didn't really give me a better understanding of languages per se (I'd actually studied linguistics by that time already), but I can imagine that it makes it easier to acquire natural languages. I'm not familiar with Ido, so I cannot say anything specifically to that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It's easy to handle single-word nouns (translating from English), because, well, they are one word. An example of a single word noun is &quot;tree&quot;. In my case, I just prefix them with `a`. But it gets more complex when you consider more complex multi-word nouns. Some examples include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The big old tree.&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The big old oak tree.&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The tree leaf forest.&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The dirt path.&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The dirt path area.&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The town grocery store.&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_All my examples are where there is a main noun at the end, and everything else comes after the `The` (it prefixes the noun). But I'm sure there are examples you could come up with where everything else comes after (or surrounds) the key noun, I can't think of any off the top of my head for English._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first one consists of what are traditionally called **adjectives** I think. As `big` and `old` are just simple adjectives. Adjectives are known as &quot;noun modifiers&quot;. In my foobar (fake, for demonstration purposes) conlang, adjectives are prefixed with `u`, so it makes it easy: `ubig uold atree`. Cool, that should work...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But then it gets more complicated. &quot;Oak tree&quot; is a type of thing. You could say &quot;oak&quot; is an adjective, but is it really? I don't know for sure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then it gets even more complicated. The phrase `tree leaf forest` should probably be written `tree-leaf forest`, but when speaking you don't denote hyphens, so there's that. But all 3 of these words themselves (standalone) are nouns (&quot;tree&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;forest&quot;). So do I mark them as noun-after-noun, or a bunch of adjectives followed by a single trailing noun. That is the key question I am asking, is it the pattern (in English or any other language), that the noun is either _by definition_ or _by some principle_ **a single word** (like the trailing `forest` in `tree leaf forest`) and the rest are adjectives? Or how should we think of this?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The phrase `dirt path area` has the same exact problem. What is to be a noun, what is to be a noun-modifier? Because &quot;old&quot; and &quot;dirt&quot; are very different, &quot;old&quot; on its own is an adjective/noun-modifier, while &quot;dirt&quot; on its own is a noun (&quot;old path forest&quot; vs. &quot;dirt path forest&quot;), shouldn't they be distinguished in some way in theory? By that I mean, grammatically classified differently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the last case, &quot;grocery store&quot; is the noun, so there is a case where actually, it's not the trailing single one-word noun that should be marked as a noun, it is the 2 word phrase &quot;grocery store&quot; that should be marked as a whole noun. But preceding &quot;grocery store&quot; is &quot;town&quot;, which is also (standalone) a noun, but in this case acting as an adjective. But really, &quot;grocery&quot; is the &quot;type&quot; of store, so store is the noun, and grocery is the adjective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm sure there are cases where the noun is 3 words, but I can't think of any (&quot;coffee shop&quot; is 2, &quot;full moon&quot;, or perhaps 3 would be &quot;assistant state secretary&quot;). Oh but then you have &quot;assistant state secretary Jane Doe&quot;. In the first case you have &quot;secretary&quot; as the trailing noun (&quot;assistant&quot;, and &quot;state&quot;, being adjectives I guess?), but in the second one &quot;secretary&quot; is now an adjective? And &quot;Jane Doe&quot; is the noun?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically the question is, what counts as a noun when there are other seemingly-&quot;modifiers&quot; present around the noun, and what counts as a modifier?"

I have to some degree (i.e. a little bit) studied the grammar of Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Sanskrit, and Hebrew, and know Spanish relatively well in comparison from school, though my main language is obviously English. By &quot;study&quot;, I don't know all of the grammatical structures of these languages, but I get some of the basics and have gathered inspiration from them. I have decided I like Chinese (Mandarin) and Vietnamese for the &quot;atomicity&quot; (analytical language), where every word is an atom and there are no word conjugations or the like, even for things like making it past tense (&quot;wanted&quot; vs. &quot;want&quot; in English).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But such an atomic/analytic language comes at a cost, you have an extra word for very common things like the past tense of a verb. So I am making some of these common things be turned into a suffix. But it turns out, just by making tenses, plurals, and a few other things into suffixes, it is already starting to look a lot like English  or Spanish. Also, I learned from Hebrew that they have the definite article (like &quot;the&quot; equivalent) prefix every word if you have a complex noun. I think that is repetitive, so I like the way English does it just saying &quot;the&quot; once at the beginning of a phrase. Now, Chinese doesn't use &quot;the&quot; at all, they omit the word entirely. I don't really like losing that extra information (even though in theory you can regain it from context, but I don't know Chinese well enough to see how this really _feels_ omitting the word &quot;the&quot;). So I am opting to have the concept of &quot;the&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sanskrit has way more verb and noun inflections, but I want to keep most of the words atomic so I don't do anywhere near as many as they do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That gets us through the words pretty much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After all of this, we are left with sentence structure. I like the idea of SVO rather than VSO or VOS because SVO seems like (in principle) it _flows_ from one thing to the next, like a programming language. You start with the subject, it &quot;pipes&quot; into the verb as input, and then you pipe in the object from the other side. I mean technically with &quot;piping&quot; you might think &quot;SOV&quot; might make more sense, but splitting the subject and object with a verb means it's easier to distinguish between them. But this is, again, like how English (and Spanish and Chinese) does it. So it _seems_ like I haven't even looked at other languages to mix it up and not be so &quot;English-centric&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So then my sentences are basically like English in the end (since I have &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and SVO, with a few word suffixes):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;the&gt; &lt;tree&gt; &lt;fall&gt; &lt;down&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this gets to the main question. The last real big piece is how to deal with noun modifiers (&quot;adjectives&quot;) and verb modifiers (&quot;adverbs&quot;). In English, they appear _all over the place_ in the sentence. Sometimes they appear before the word (&quot;the tree **actually** fell&quot;), sometimes after (&quot;the tree fell **down**&quot;). Sometimes both (&quot;the tree **actually** fell **down**&quot;). That is for adverbs, but for adjectives too (&quot;I see the **big tree*&quot;, which I guess is an _attributive_ adjective, vs. _predicative_ adjectives which I can't think of an example of adjective appearing after a noun).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I am wondering, what are all the ways these &quot;inspiration&quot; languages (in terms of my project) handle adjectives/adverbs (&quot;modifiers&quot;)? Are there any languages which greatly _restrict_ their placement in the sentence to only one position (either before or after the noun/verb)? If so, what are some examples in either Chinese, Vietnamese, Sanskrit, and/or Hebrew (or all 4 of them), of if they don't have that feature, what is a language that does (with an example)? If there is a good conlang which demonstrates it, that would be an interesting comment too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically I am trying to not make this language feel like &quot;I just slightly modified English&quot;. I thought about the word/sentence features of many other languages and feel I like this structure I have landed on the best so far, but there is still room for improvement and getting better/more _influence_ from these other few languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Sanskrit)."

That's a very ambitious project though, and there are various easier things you can do that takes you a long way!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Separate **what** to say from **how* to say it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance: Being a native English speaker, you are accustomed to having a definite article in your language, as you like being able to separate &quot;the cat&quot; from just any other cat in every sentence. Fine. You know what you want to say. If you want your language to seem more exotic, ask yourself if the way the English language expresses this feature is the only way, or if you could come up with something else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My native language is Swedish, and we make also make the distinction between definite and indefinite. We don't have a word like your &quot;the&quot;, however, but instead use different endings to convey the same meaning. Much like English does with the plural. Consider the following translations from English to Swedish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;katt&quot;, &quot;the cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;katten&quot;, &quot;cats&quot; -&gt; &quot;katter&quot;, &quot;the cats&quot; -&gt; &quot;katterna&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I started learning English at school I was faced with this strange structure, but the underlying concept was familiar. I could thus relatively seamlessly translate one construction to the other. If my native language had not had the same distinction it would likely have been much harder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mention that you know some Spanish, and though definite articles work the same you could observe differences from English there as well. One is that pronouns are not necessary in a Spanish sentence, since this information is expressed in the verb endings. &quot;Voy a comer&quot; translates readily to &quot;I'm going to eat&quot;, but take a look at the two sentences and you'll find they are **very** different. The Spanish one has no pronoun. The English one has the unit &quot;I'm&quot;, which could either be interpreted as a pronoun and a verb not present in the Spanish one, or as a unit corresponding to Spanish &quot;soy&quot;. Then follows the word &quot;going&quot; which has the same basic meaning as Spanish &quot;soy&quot; but in a completely different form. You _could_ translate &quot;voy&quot; to the English unit &quot;I'll&quot;, but even then that's no exact word-by-word translation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: How could you express your desired distinction between definite and indefinite? One way would be to keep the article, but place it _after_ the noun instead. You could use suffixes, like Scandinavian languages, or why not prefixes? Word order?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same procedure can be used for other things you want your language to express.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A comment on SVO word order:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you really sure your interpreting this as the most _logical_ has noting to do with English being a SOV language? Couldn't you just as well argue that verb-first structures are &quot;more like programming&quot; in that you first state a function and then its inputs? And if not, wouldn't  your comparison to piping fit better with OVS word order?

Past vs non-past doesn't get an explicit marking here, but the next verb after this point in the sentence changes its form, so syntacticians generally say there's an invisible element which exists in that position and tells the next verb to change its form. This position in the sentence is generally called &quot;T&quot;, for &quot;tense&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aspect and voice, on the other hand, are indicated by _auxiliary verbs_ in between &quot;T&quot; and the verb: it _was_ written, it _was being_ written, it _had been being_ written. This position in the sentence is sometimes called &quot;Aux&quot;, for &quot;auxiliary&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some syntacticians claim that this is universally true. All languages work like English and have a &quot;T&quot; position and an &quot;Aux&quot; position and the &quot;Aux&quot; position is used to indicate aspect and voice. According to these syntacticians, if a language _doesn't_ indicate aspect with an auxiliary, it's because there's actually an _invisible hidden auxiliary_, it's there but we can't see it. You may have run into these claims before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many other syntacticians, though, think this is stupid. Because many languages really don't seem to have auxiliary verbs for aspect like English does. In Latin and Ancient Greek, for example, it's marked directly on the verb:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - _Currebam_ &quot;I was running&quot;, _cucurrī_ &quot;I ran&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - Ἔφευγον &quot;I was running&quot;, ἔφυγον &quot;I ran&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other languages, such as German (see jk's answer for examples), don't have any explicit marking for this sort of aspect distinction at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Still others use something other than an auxiliary verb. Egyptian uses a preposition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- _jw.f ꜣtp ꜥꜣ.f_ &quot;he loads up his donkey&quot;, _jw.f **ḥr** ꜣtp ꜥꜣ.f_ &quot;he **is** loading up his donkey&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Ḥr_ is a preposition literally meaning &quot;on&quot;, derived from a noun meaning &quot;face&quot; or &quot;surface&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't go for the &quot;every language actually works exactly like English&quot; theory (most linguists nowadays don't), I suspect English is in the minority here. Auxiliary verbs for aspectual information show up in some other non-English languages as well, such as Lingála, but most languages either put the marking directly on the verb, or don't mark it explicitly at all."

Even long words in a language you are familiar with will be quite easy to pronounce (provided you can remember them), whereas short words in languages with a very different phonology could be much harder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In agglutinative languages you have the equivalent of a sentence or phrase in one word; that is essentially the same as writing a sentence in English without spaces and saying that -- this should not be any more difficult than saying the sentences in the 'normal' way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The compound word in your language is only hard because to people not knowing the language it is a meaningless collection of letters. If you had &quot;thirdfingeredabnormality&quot;, this would be easy to say for any English speaker, as you can make sense of groups of letters. If I gave you &quot;Dreifingrigebesonderheit&quot; (an approximate German translation), it's still easy for me (as I speak German), and you might find it easier (even if you did not speak German yourself) because there is some resemblance to English morphemes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to summarise, it's familiarity, not length, which is the main factor in determining how difficult something is to pronounce. And reading comprehension of long words is fine, as long as you can make sense of their components, just as you make sense of the words in a (long) sentence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For non-agglutinative languages: German forms compounds by simply joining words together (possible with linking morphemes), where English links them but keeps spaces or hyphenation. This is rarely taken to extremes, but you can form quite long words. One infamous example is the _Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän_, the &quot;captain of the Danube steam boat company&quot;. You could easily expand it to refer to his daughter, the _Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitänstochter_, etc. Any German speaker would immediately understand the meaning of those words without difficulty."

So even ignoring agreement marking, it's clear that _mimi ninapenda yeye_ means &quot;I love him&quot;, not &quot;he loves me&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Swahili also allows pronouns to be incorporated into the verb itself, as an alternate way of indicating subjects and objects.

In a sentence like &quot;the scientist loves the engineer&quot;, there's no case marking at all, but it's completely unambiguous who's the subject and who's the object. The fact that we still have different forms for &quot;I&quot; versus &quot;me&quot; is more a historical accident than anything that actually carries functional load."

But by the time of Plato, it no longer seems to be a part of the language's phonological system; it's just a quirk of this one prefix.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If ending in a vowel, and the next begins with a vowel, you put a y or w between. So a + ama would become &quot;awama&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is called &quot;epenthesis&quot; and it's one type of phonological process, which is also quite common. The difference between this and allomorphy is that these phonological processes seem to happen at a different level; it doesn't matter that it's specifically the prefix _a-_ being used here, it just matters that two `/a/` phonemes ended up next to each other, and that's not allowed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Otherwise, if you just let them _merge_ together (and remove the head/tail of the joining pair), then you lose some information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sure, but natural languages have a high degree of redundancy, so losing a couple bits of information here isn't a problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How do natural languages (or conlangs for that matter) deal with this problem? Like in Sanskrit, or Latin, I see these sorts of prefixes/suffixes like my examples, and yet somehow the system seems to work (I haven't studied enough examples in each language though to know how/why it seems to work). What constraints do they place on the system? Etc. How do they create a prefix/suffix system that just works?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Latin, at least, only the last phoneme of a prefix ever gets changed when it attaches, and there usually isn't much functional load on this last phoneme. This makes sense, because if the assimilation had ever created an unacceptable ambiguity, speakers would have found some way to fix that (by, say, ceasing to use one of the ambiguous prefixes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So when we do occasionally see a high functional load on the last phoneme of a prefix (_ad-esse_ &quot;to be present&quot; vs _ab-esse_ &quot;to be absent&quot;), the system must have some way of keeping them distinct; in this case, _ad-esse_ is able to assimilate in forms like _assum_ &quot;I am present&quot; and _affuī_ &quot;I was present&quot;, while _ab-esse_ is not (_absum_, _abfuī_). If it didn't, speakers would have found, created, and used workarounds over the centuries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.inuktitutcomputing.ca/Technocrats/ILFT.php" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Nowadays in American English they tend to refer to sex and bodily functions (fuck, shit, ass, slut). In other, usually older varieties of English, they had more to do with religion (damn, hell, bloody). In Classical Latin you would swear by a god or a demigod (one of the most common expletives is usually translated &quot;by Hercules&quot;). In some long-ago ancestor of English, the Proto-Indo-European word for &quot;bear&quot; seems to have become taboo, which is why we say &quot;bear&quot; (possibly from a root for &quot;brown&quot;, possibly from a root for &quot;wild animal&quot;, there's not a consensus) instead of some cognate with Greek _arktos_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The one constant, though, is that there'll always be _some_ sort of taboo (both culturally and linguistically).

That's a very ambitious project though, and there are easier things you can do that takes you a long way!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Separate **what** to say from **how** to say it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance: Being a native English speaker, you are accustomed to having a definite article in your language, as you like being able to separate &quot;the cat&quot; from just any other cat in every sentence. Fine. You know what you want to say. If you want your language to seem more exotic, ask yourself if the way the English language expresses this feature is the only way, or if you could come up with something else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My native language is Swedish, and we also make the distinction between definite and indefinite. We don't have a word like your &quot;the&quot;, however, but instead use different endings to convey the same meaning. Much like English does with the plural. Consider the following translations from English to Swedish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;katt&quot;, &quot;the cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;katten&quot;, &quot;cats&quot; -&gt; &quot;katter&quot;, &quot;the cats&quot; -&gt; &quot;katterna&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I started learning English at school I was faced with this strange structure (the English &quot;the&quot;), but the underlying concept was familiar. I could thus relatively seamlessly translate one construction to the other. If my native language had not had the same distinction it would likely have been much harder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mention that you know some Spanish, and though definite articles work the same you could observe differences from English there as well. One is that pronouns are not necessary in a Spanish sentence, since this information is expressed in the verb endings. &quot;Voy a comer&quot; translates readily to &quot;I'm going to eat&quot;, but take a look at the two sentences and you'll find they are **very** different. The Spanish one has no pronoun. The English one has the unit &quot;I'm&quot;, which could either be interpreted as a pronoun and a verb not present in the Spanish one, or as a unit corresponding to Spanish &quot;soy&quot;. Then follows the word &quot;going&quot; which has the same basic meaning as Spanish &quot;voy&quot;, a word not used in the translation, but in a completely different form. You _could_ translate &quot;voy&quot; to the English unit &quot;I'll&quot; and make the whole sentence &quot;I'll eat&quot;, but even then that doesn't constitute an exact word-by-word translation as the word &quot;a&quot; would have been taken out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: How could you express your desired distinction between definite and indefinite? One way would be to keep the article, but place it _after_ the noun instead. You could use suffixes, like Scandinavian languages, or why not prefixes? Word order? Keep this particular feature the same as in English, but change something else? You have lots of possibilities!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same procedure can be used for other things you want your language to express.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A comment on SVO word order:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you really sure your interpreting this as the most _logical_ has noting to do with English being a SVO language? Couldn't you just as well argue that verb-first structures are &quot;more like programming&quot; in that you first state a function and then its inputs? And if not, wouldn't  your comparison to piping fit better with OVS word order? If I tell my terminal to &quot;ls | grep .pdf&quot; it first gets the list of files, the &quot;object&quot;, and then feeds this to grep, which could be seen as either the subject or the verb, which filters out the lines containing &quot;.pdf&quot;."

For example, &quot;must begin with a consonant&quot;, &quot;can't include `/θ/`&quot;, and &quot;must end in a consonant other than `/h/`&quot; are all constraints. But the language would also include constraints like, say, &quot;don't insert an `/h/`&quot; (to keep `/h/`s from appearing in random places). And the relative ranking of these constraints would determine what happens to foreign words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, maybe &quot;must begin with a consonant&quot; outranks &quot;don't insert an extra `/ʔ/`&quot;. So given the choice between letting a foreign word start with a vowel (violates the first constraint) and inserting an `/ʔ/` at the beginning (violates the second constraint), speakers would choose the second option. Why an `/ʔ/` rather than any other consonant? Well, maybe &quot;don't insert a `/q/`&quot; outranks &quot;don't insert an `/ʔ/`&quot; too, so inserting `/ʔ/` is preferable to inserting `/q/`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to optimality theorists, every language includes a vast, near-infinite set of these constraints, with a strict ranking, and speakers will unconsciously modify words to comply with them. One advantage of this explanation is that the same constraints are used for native words as for foreign words, so you don't have to invoke any special machinery to make it work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't believe in OT (i.e. you prefer rule-based systems over constraint-based systems), you'll generally have a set of _repair rules_ that are invoked whenever a word violates a language's phonotactics. These rules are specific to each individual language, and their goal is to fix all the violations. If your phonotactics don't allow `/ħ/`, for example, you might have a repair rule that says &quot;replace `/ħ/` with `/h/`&quot;. If your phonotactics require consonants at the start of a word, you might have a repair rule that says &quot;insert `/ʔ/` before an initial vowel&quot;. And so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This explanation has the advantage that it clearly explains why all languages seem to have their own idiosyncratic repair rules, which aren't generally necessary for native words. For example, all Swahili words must end in a vowel. When a foreign word doesn't, an `/i/` is generally inserted. An optimality theorist would say this is because of some special constraint that's never needed for native words, while a rule-based phonologist would say there's just a repair rule that inserts that `/i/`. (Māori and Japanese similarly _usually_ require words to end in a vowel; Māori inserts `/a/`, Japanese inserts `/u/`. So this doesn't seem to be something universal.)"

I speak English as my first language, where most of our swear words are known as &quot;potty language&quot; &amp; for good reason. Most of the English swears are about sex or the body. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In French, the language of my dad's family, a bunch of the swears are evangelical. I'm not sure that's the right word. What I mean is that most curse words are about the church. Now there's an interesting point to be heard there! What do we call swears? &quot;Spitting oaths&quot;? Promises basically. Using the Lord's name in vain. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the Lord's name in vain does NOT primarily mean &quot;oh my god lol&quot;, it means &quot;I swear to God&quot; or when you put your hand on the bible in a courtroom &amp; say &quot;I swear to speak the truth&quot; or whatever. If you keep your word, then good for you. It is &quot;bad&quot; when you swear on the bible or God's name &amp; then break your promise/oath. So that might be why French swears are often religious. Similar to the religion argument, bad words are often called &quot;curse&quot; words. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I recommend watching this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGcDi0DRtU comedy sketch &amp; I think he has done a few more acts about curse words too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I had read a book series (Codex Alera) where they use &quot;crows&quot; as a swear word. I think this is because crows are a motif throughout the books &amp; might have some sort of special power, which means that they always end up on battlefields, feasting on the carrion &amp; fallen friends. I believe Carrion &amp; Maggots might also be swears. &quot;Crows take it/you&quot; means &quot;god-damn it/you&quot;. They even just use &quot;(oh) crows&quot; to mean &quot;(oh) heck/shit&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They use &quot;Bloody&quot; (as in &quot;bloody crows&quot; to mean &quot;holy shit/smokes/cow/crap&quot; or &quot;bloody/fucking hell&quot;) which is a word used in this world. Bloody is used as an intensifier. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In relation to the religious swear/curse words, they also say &quot;great furies&quot; as in &quot;oh my god&quot;. The furies are basically (pokemon crossed with spirit guides crossed with the concept of animism) who give powers to the owners like bending in ATLA. The great furies are like the spirit who lives in the mountain &amp; his wife the storm/wind/bad weather on top of the mountain. So they can swear by the Great Furies as the folks on earth say &quot;I swear to the Fae&quot; or &quot;God help me&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another concept to consider is slurs. Slurs are usually based on or used against marginalized communities. (Black people &amp; any marginalized racial/cultural/ethnic group; down syndrome, autism, learning disabilities, &amp; other mental illnesses, neurodivergencies, &amp; disabilities; Romani/Roma (this one is actually a huge issue bc I know people **named** the G slur); trans, gay, otherwise queer, &amp; intersex; etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So to answer your questions: &#xD;&#xA;**How many swear words should you have in a conlang,**&#xD;&#xA;You only really need one or two source words, but you can use as many as one curse for every noun, verb, &amp; adjective you invent. You could also choose a source category (religion, sex, even smth like plants or careers). Having a category might be able to limit you to a degree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**and how are they designed?** &#xD;&#xA;I believe they usually come up naturally. Maybe through mistakes. Maybe some teen afraid of sexual maturity tries to desexualize things by thinking of different words (like &quot;feet&quot; in the bible, or maybe pull smth out of ur ass like &quot;hawthorn berries&quot;) &amp; then they accidentally pavlov themself into sexualizing hawthorn berries &amp; now hawthorn berries are a euphemism  for sex. As mentioned with the crows, they could be related to undesirable topics like death. In cultures where nudity is natural I would assume that sex swears are less common. (They sexualize people less in those cultures than cultures where modesty is the norm. Typically. I'm generalizing.) So if sex is a taboo topic, swears would be about sex. If death is a taboo topic, then swears about death would be more common. If the taboo topic is malicious magic, then curse words might actually be about curses! Slurs have more defined or easily assigned sources. Swears can be considered a subset of slang. I also had a thought while answering one of the later questions: Things that used to be ok are now slurs because the people are still hated. &quot;coloured&quot; used to be the correct term, but since society still hated POC it stopped being a proper term. &quot;L**e&quot; used to be the used term, but it is a slur, so people started using &quot;handicapped&quot;, but that term also started feeling offensive &amp; now &quot;disabled&quot; is the correct term. It is in part due to inaccuracies in language I suppose. Like how &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; is a perfectly useful term for hermaphroditic animals but is not an accurate term for humans (with disorders/differences in sexual development or who are intersex). This is more slur based than swear based though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What is their purpose really?**&#xD;&#xA;Their purpose is to emphasize. I don't usually swear, but sometimes, sometimes there is a situation that really warrants an oath. Promises (swear to god) are used to create honesty &amp; binding. As in they are bound to their word. I think swears are also used as catharsis or emotional indicators. You use swears when you're angry, when you're courting someone, when you're really really excited... They are for emphasis, usually emotional. That's my opinion at least! My experience is my own.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**And should any other &quot;regular&quot; words be constructed out of them?** &quot;Like if &quot;bar&quot; was a swear word, then &quot;foobar&quot; was a goose or &quot;barfoo&quot; was a house,&quot; &#xD;&#xA;I think maybe the other way around? As a mentally ill baker I deal with the term &quot;retarded fermentation&quot; because the word &quot;retard&quot; (the e is pronounced like &quot;look&quot;) means &quot;late&quot;. Tardy. I mentioned I speak french lol. A retarded fermentation is a fermentation (in sourdough) that takes extra long to develop more flavour. Slow. Late. When this term applies to a person, it means they are &quot;mentally slow&quot; I guess. Which is kind of true. You know how your brain is not fully developed until age 26? A ton of mentally ill/neurodivergent people don't finish brain development until age 30 ish. I think that it is more likely that words (that have related words) turn into slurs. Whether or not the related words are considered slurs is really a societal/cultural thing &amp; can depend on the worldview of the people. Sam hill versus damn hell? Idk. One last thing to note: Basement is not a sexual word even though it has &quot;semen&quot; in the spelling. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**is that a problem?**&#xD;&#xA;It depends. I said it was a cultural thing. If you use a slur in a hockey name (Like the new york n*****s or smth) then yes that is a problem &amp; a slur! If the word &quot;semen&quot; is in the word &quot;basement&quot; then no that is not an issue, they have different etymologies. For things like &quot;retarded fermentation&quot;? Well that's a touchy one. I dislike the term because the source word is now used as a slur, but it was chosen for its accuracy. Maybe changing it to &quot;Fermentation retardé&quot; would be better because it has a different pronunciation &amp; placement &amp; maybe that would be enough. For words like &quot;asshole&quot; to mean &quot;anus&quot; I would say that yes it is still considered a swear word because the first part, &quot;ass&quot; is used **because** it is a dirty word for bum. &quot;pussy hair&quot; would also be considered like that because it is the hair of the swear word, unlike pubic hair which is a perfectly fine term. So in general I would say it depends on how the words relate &amp; how society reacts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Also, what are swear words actually,** &#xD;&#xA;I feel like I answered this ok throughout this answer. A swear word is a word with a connotation of unprofessionalism that is used colloquially to add emotional emphasis. Although the connotation of swears/swearing can change throughout cultures &amp; time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**do they have a consistent meaning across cultures?**&#xD;&#xA;Ah yes I just answered this! They do not have a consistent meaning! From my experience they have the connotation of rudeness &amp; emphasis, but to other cultures they can be related more to spiritual impurity or the keeping of promises. They almost definitely have even more meanings in other cultures &amp; languages. What is considered a &quot;bad word&quot; might not be what we consider &quot;swear&quot; words or &quot;potty&quot; mouth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helped!" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

You assume the existence of sentences and paragraphs already, but I think we should quickly look at them for efficiency sake. We generally learn to write a text, like an essay or a thesis, beginning with the thesis statement, the sort of summation of the whole problem the essay addresses. This is considered to be ***the statement a reader is to comprehend first***. Next down from the entire essay in hierarchy is the paragraph. Likewise, we're taught to begin each one with the main sentence, that one that introduces the main idea to be discussed or revealed in that paragraph. Lastly in the hierarchy are sentences themselves. Interestingly, we don't order sentences &quot;logically&quot; but rather grammatically. Even though one might write a dissertation in Latin and put the thesis statement first, the sentence itself might not actually get to the point until you get to the verb way down at the end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This scheme is both Linear in the spatio-temporal sense and Top Down in the hierarchical sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Secondly**, we could consider extending this basic scheme by standardising and increasing the power of punctuation and section markings. Many technical documents do this by noting every paragraph with what amounts to a unique serial number. Often in historical grammars we find references to things like P4a.2.N3 which denotes paragraph four-A (a subset of lesser importance than para 4 itself), section 2, note 3. All in all , a very low importance reference as it's relegated to a foot or end note. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have lots of interesting, unusual and unused punctuation marks that could be regularised, standardised and ammended to fulfil several key roles from marking importance to speculation or editorialisation. We have things like interrobangs and exclamation commas and the like; some languages have sectional punctuation. All of these could be incorporated into the existing scheme relatively easily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Thirdly**, we should take a look at other systems entirely different. First, let's take a look at music and in specific the [conductor's score][1]. Unlike an individual musician, the conductor has access to all the parts that are playing at any moment in the piece of music. Very much like what you're looking for, the conductor needs to be aware at any moment of &quot;what is to be comprehended first&quot; and &quot;how does the whole text flow&quot;. Although music itself is linear, and the most important theme or idea isn't necessarily the first thing you hear!, the reader of the score needs to comprehend all the different sections, moving parts, thematic ideas and when they all occur.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you look in the images in the link, the conductor has marked up the &quot;text&quot; of the music by coordinating various divisions by colour, notes when various themes, motifs and entrances occur and the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even in an individual musician's score or in a piano work, you'll find plenty of &quot;flow&quot; markings: dynamic changes, pedal settings, phrasal markings, accentuation types as well as stylistic &amp; tempo markings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some types of music rely heavily on flow marking, for example the genre of [unmeasured music][3]. Melodic and harmonic flow are indicated by the composer through the use of sweeping and flowing lines, but the interpretation and execution of the flow is the work of the player.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another system to look at is hypertext. We've all used it when we hover over highlighted key words and clicked on links to supporting data. And we've all wondered why the composer chose to link two things together that don't make sense just because the other word is spelled the same. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This system allows the writer to make use of the linear nature of reading to ensure that more important topics are marked and read first, but also allows freedom to move between sections and also to dive deeper into a topic through the system of links and hovertext.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wiktionary puts this to good use by ordering the Important Stuff on the main article page, while linking to supporting data, historical changes, usage quotations, and hiding grammatical apparatus and the like in spoilers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take [at-baill][5] for instance, an Old Irish verb meaning to throw. The key points and flow are handled here on this primary page with its sections delineated (word, etymology, pronunciation, parts of speech, declension/conjugation, descendants, etc. Clicking on the spoiler bar opens up a whole new view into the agony of grammar. Especially for anyone who thinks Greek verbs are truculent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The links in all the sections lead one down rabbit holes of time and space and history into other languages, other peoples' perceptions, related forms, semantic drift and all kinds of other interesting inquiries that don't have anything at all to do with the basic thesis you started out with!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][6]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.approachtoconducting.com/en/capitolo.php?section=7&amp;subsection=41&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRpJs.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-xTvfr3nJ8&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/aualE.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atbaill&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3Hi5.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The letter is numbered [276](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_276) in *The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the relevant part of the letter:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Núminor*. C. S. Lewis was one of the only three persons who have so far read all or a considerable pan of my 'mythology' of the First and Second Ages, which had already been in the main lines constructed before we met. He had the peculiarity that he liked to be read to. All that he knew of my 'matter' was what his capacious but not infallible memory retained from my reading to him as sole audience. His spelling *numinor* is a hearing error, aided, no doubt, by his association of the name with Latin *nūmen*, *nūmina*, and the adjective 'numinous'. Unfortunate, since the name has no such connexions, and has no reference to 'divinity' or sense of its presence. It is a construction from the Eldarin base √NDU 'below, down; descend'; Q. *núme* 'going down, occident'; *númen* 'the&#xD;&#xA;direction or region of the sunset' +*nóre* 'land' as an inhabited area. I have often used *Westernesse* as a translation. This is derived from rare Middle English *Westernesse* (known to me only in MS. C of *King Horn*) where the meaning is vague, but may be taken to mean 'Western lands' as distinct from the East inhabited by the Paynim and Saracens. Lewis took no pan in 'research into Númenor'. N. is my personal alteration of the Atlantis myth and/or tradition, and accommodation of it to my general mythology. Of all the mythical or 'archetypal' images this is the one most deeply seated in my&#xD;&#xA;imagination, and for many years I had a recurrent Atlantis dream : the stupendous and ineluctable wave advancing from the Sea or over the land, sometimes dark, sometimes green and sunlit.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Lewis was, I think, impressed by 'the Silmarillion and all that', and certainly retained some vague memories of it and of its names in mind. For instance, since he had heard it, before he composed or thought of *Out of the Silent Planet*, I imagine that *Eldil* is an echo of the *Eldar*; in *Perelandra* 'Tor and Tinidril' are certainly an echo, since Tuor and Idril, parents of Eärendil, are major characters in 'The Fall of Gondolin', the earliest written of the legends of the First Age. But&#xD;&#xA;his own mythology (incipient and never fully realized) was quite different. It was at any rate broken to bits before it became coherent by contact with C. S. Williams and his 'Arthurian' stuff – which happened between *Perelandra* and *That Hideous Strength*. A pity, I think. But then I was and&#xD;&#xA;remain wholly unsympathetic to Williams' mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This was mentioned in the 2005 paper &quot;[The Inklings: Connecting the Unconnected: Genre, intertextuality and intersemiosis](https://www.academia.edu/324279/The_Inklings_Connecting_the_Unconnected_Genre_intertextuality_and_intersemiosis)&quot; by Tommi Nieminen (Department of General Linguistics, University of Helsinki, Finland):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When Tolkien and Lewis made an mutual agreement to write two science fiction stories—Tolkien of a time travel, Lewis of a space travel—, and Lewis produced the first part of the *Ransom* trilogy, *Out of the Silent Planet* (1943), it was just as much an allegory as were his previous works, or the later ones such as the *Narnia* series (1950–56). Even the names borrowed from Tolkien to the *Ransom* novels—taken not from Tolkien’s writings but his reading aloud *The Silmarillion* stories in the Inklings meetings—were given so different second-world interpretations that they do not carry anything of Tolkien’s world to Lewis’s.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This was the only confirmed use that I could identify. Others have theorized that other words were borrowed from Tolkien's conlangs, such as the name of the palace in *Narnia*, Cair Paravel. &quot;Cair&quot; in Sindarin means &quot;ship&quot;. This is discussed in more depth on [TheTolkienForum.com](https://www.thetolkienforum.com/threads/etymology-of-narn-in-tolkiens-and-lewis-works.23342/), but ultimately it looks like both sources of Cair come from the welsh word &quot;Caer&quot;, which means a stronghold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only confirmed use I found was the use of names by Lewis in the *Ransom* trilogy mentioned above."

We know French is written that way because of its historical development, and that it conjugates the verbs for different persons, and has gender and number coded in the pronouns, which the written language maintains. But if French wasn't written down (or it was written in a script that was strictly phonetic), and you only had a small sample size, you might come to the conclusion that the verb &quot;to run&quot;, *koor*, wasn't conjugated in the present tense, and that French didn't differentiate between singular and plural in the third person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, if you only had the written text, you might think that my examples above were pronounced *je koors*, *too koors*, *ill koort*, *ell koort*, *ills koor-ent* and *ells koor-ent* (or maybe *koo-rent*)."

Text="In the long term, learning another language reasonably well is probably the only way to get a &quot;real feel&quot; for how things can sound natural or not in other languages. That's a very ambitious project though, and there are easier things you can do that takes you a long way!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Separate **what** to say from **how** to say it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance: Being a native English speaker, you are accustomed to having a definite article in your language, as you like being able to separate &quot;the cat&quot; from just any other cat in every sentence. Fine. You know what you want to say. If you want your language to seem more exotic, ask yourself if the way the English language expresses this feature is the only way, or if you could come up with something else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My native language is Swedish, and we also make the distinction between definite and indefinite. We don't have a word like your &quot;the&quot;, however, but instead use different endings to convey the same meaning. Much like English does with the plural. Consider the following translations from English to Swedish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;katt&quot;, &quot;the cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;katten&quot;, &quot;cats&quot; -&gt; &quot;katter&quot;, &quot;the cats&quot; -&gt; &quot;katterna&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I started learning English at school I was faced with this strange structure (the English &quot;the&quot;), but the underlying concept was familiar. I could thus relatively seamlessly translate one construction to the other. If my native language had not had the same distinction it would likely have been much harder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mention that you know some Spanish, and though definite articles work the same you could observe differences from English there as well. One is that pronouns are not necessary in a Spanish sentence, since this information is expressed in the verb endings. &quot;Voy a comer&quot; translates readily to &quot;I'm going to eat&quot;, but take a look at the two sentences and you'll find they are **very** different. The Spanish one has no pronoun. The English one has the unit &quot;I'm&quot;, which could either be interpreted as a pronoun and a verb not present in the Spanish one, or as a unit corresponding to Spanish &quot;soy&quot;. Then follows the word &quot;going&quot; which has the same basic meaning as Spanish &quot;voy&quot;, a word that _is_ used in the translation, but in a completely different form. You _could_ translate &quot;voy&quot; to the English unit &quot;I'll&quot; and make the whole sentence &quot;I'll eat&quot;, but even then that doesn't constitute an exact word-by-word translation as the word &quot;a&quot; would have been taken out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: How could you express your desired distinction between definite and indefinite? One way would be to keep the article, but place it _after_ the noun instead. You could use suffixes, like Scandinavian languages, or why not prefixes? Word order? Keep this particular feature the same as in English, but change something else? You have lots of possibilities!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same procedure can be used for other things you want your language to express.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A comment on SVO word order:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you really sure your interpreting this as the most _logical_ has noting to do with English being a SVO language? Couldn't you just as well argue that verb-first structures are &quot;more like programming&quot; in that you first state a function and then its inputs? And if not, wouldn't  your comparison to piping fit better with OVS word order?

This makes it fairly easy to go back in time, change the evolution of the sounds or orthography, and use an existing vocabulary from the already existing Greek Language to create an artificial dialect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, I could thus look at the dialectical declension of a word like σύ, and see that in the Genitive, Attic renders it σοῦ, Ionic σεῦ and others σέο, and infer that the root/stem is σε-, and that the contraction rules show that the irregular declension is σε-ο, then insert my own sound changes based off my own set of rules. &#xD;&#xA;Likewise I can find out that σφᾶς is a normal contraction of σφέας or σφέανς with an irregular enclitic of σφε. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I can't seem to do is take a root that is only used in the dual and transfer it to the plural. In the rare First Person dual, the pronouns used are (NA) νώ and (DG) νῷν.

But these have no real basis in the Greek evolution from its first ancestors to Classical Greek. I can't use σφεῖς or σφώ or σφωέ to trace a pattern without a good reason, because all of them seem to have their patterns traced from the evolution of ὑμεῖς, σφι, and νώ. &#xD;&#xA;Where do irregular declensions come from, and how are they most authentically reproduced in a constructed dialect?&#xD;&#xA;I am not a professional, so please give me some leeway if I have made errors presenting this question.

Redundancy (ie &quot;superfluous&quot; information) improves the robustness of transmission of a message, so while you can reduce it in artificial languages to increase the bandwidth, you trade this off against a higher rate of errors and failed transmissions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now imagine you had a list of spells, and in order to reduce the time needed to cast them, they are all abbreviated with a six-digit/letter code. Now you have a noisy environment, say during a storm or a battle, and you want to cast a particular spell. How likely is it that one of the letters or digits is coming across wrongly to the receiver of that spell? And then, instead of a fireball, you might create a bunch of flowers instead. Or you summon the wrong demon. There's a reason why phonetic alphabets (&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;...) exist. Similarly, a single spelling mistake (no pun intended) can achieve the same disastrous outcome in writing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to increase the robustness of your words, you could reduce the number of phonemes (as there is, say, no danger of confusing /k/ and /g/ if they don't make a distinction in your language); then either the words need to be longer (see eg some Hawai'ian words), or you need longer phrases (as you will have fewer words available that are not long) or multiple sentences (see eg toki pona).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately there are certain quantitative properties of language (or any code for that matter) which cannot be overcome: you can't increase the amount of information transmitted without also increasing the danger of corrupting the message. Natural languages seem to have found a good balance over time to ensure adequate speed of information transmission overall.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your message can be transmitted repeatedly (eg in a casual conversation), getting it wrong occasionally might not be a problem (as long as you notice it), but for a high-stakes, one-off communicative event (spell casting, military comms [see Charge of the Light Brigade], safety warnings, ...)

At best, if you find a word commonly next to a picture of a tree, you could assume the word actually does mean &quot;tree&quot;, and try to deduce the meanings of a few other words from that? (Or, as Chadwick did with Linear B, guess that a word is the name of a city) (Or, as Champollion did with Hieroglyphics, guess that a word is the name of a ruler/pharaoh, because it's written in a special way and repeats across documents)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, onto the positives though:  &#xD;&#xA;What might be your best bet to find out is actually the grammar of the unknown language! (Though still only in tiny bits) If your language is written in an alphabet or abjad, you got the jackpot, because then you can with super high probability (given enough material) identify common affixes in words, and likely identify different sets of words which use different kinds of affixes, which allows you to distinguish word classes. Given that verbs are usually rarer in sentences than nouns (English has a lot of helper verbs, but other languages don't necessarily), and particles are usually rather short, you can even _identify_ word classes.  &#xD;&#xA;If you have a language written in a syllabary, this might well be possible as well, but will be harder. (Worse, though also better sometimes, the syllables might stretch across multiple parts of speech; see again the decipherment of Linear B, which relied critically on Alice Kober's insight that exactly this was happening, allowing her to identify syllables with common consonants/vowel contents, but afaik that only enables Chadwick's identification of some words as city names due to repeated consonants/vowels, e.g. ��� as Ko-No-So=Knossos)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, all this is way way way way way WAY more complicated than this, might well not work at all, and is probably impossible if the language is polysynthetic or the script doesn't include spaces or the script is any more complex than _just_ &quot;alphabet&quot; or _just_ &quot;syllabary&quot;. But at least, I hope I could give you some scope on the problem." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For example, during the Roman era, people all across Europe and the surrounding areas had some proficiency in Latin; people in North Africa might speak Punic as their native language, and people in Iberia might speak Iberian, but they would both know enough Latin to do business with each other. Or, think about the role of English in the modern world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These sorts of trade languages tend to come about when one group has enough social or political power that people across a wide area consider their language valuable to learn. I don't know much about Star Wars, but I can easily imagine the language of a Galactic Empire becoming one of these.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another meaning of the term is a language variety that arises specifically for trade. In this meaning, it's something like a creole, with features of different languages combining together as people try to figure out a way to communicate across language barriers (and then pass the language down to their children). The &quot;lingua franca&quot; used across the Mediterranean during the Renaissance, for example, was probably one of these; people speaking Romance, Greek, Arabic, and Turkish ended up adopting words and pieces of grammar from the other languages in order to do business and ended up with an amalgam of all four. Or for another example, Arabic-speaking traders wanted to do business with Bantu-speakers along the east coast of Africa, and the end result was Swahili.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this sort of language to arise, you need two or more groups of people with a strong need to communicate with each other, and without the sort of power differential that leads to one group's language being adopted as a default.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also worth noting that these two meanings aren't mutually exclusive: they're more like different points on a spectrum. When languages come into contact they always have an influence on each other; the question is how strong that influence is, and how intelligible the end result is to someone who only speaks one of the parent languages."

Instead, respect can be shown in other ways, such as adding a title like _bwana_ (the equivalent of English &quot;you&quot; vs &quot;you, sir&quot;).

A lot of information is lost, but there's enough redundancy that native speakers can still understand—much like how English-speakers can understand whispering, which discards most information about voicing, or styles of singing that discard some formant information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It sounds like that's not what you're looking for, though. The rest of the answer is built on the assumption that you're trying to make a language which is _only_ whistled, rather than using whistling as a lossy way of conveying a spoken language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Languages with very few phonemes exist in real life][1], so an inventory like that is plausible enough. If you want to figure out what the words would look like, I think this is a place where some basic information theory could be useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The core idea behind information theory is that you can consider a lot of different things (including a spoken language) as a series of discrete signals, transmitted one at a time from a source to a receiver, and then use some mathematical structures to analyze that. If you've got three tones and six contours, and each phoneme consists of exactly one tone and one contour, then you've got eighteen possible signals. Not knowing anything else about your language, this means you can transmit a bit over two bits of information per phoneme. Each English word generally conveys about eight bits of information (given context and such)—so completely ignoring phonotactics, syntax, and various other aspects of your language, you could theoretically encode the same amount of information as an English word with four phonemes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you add those aspects in, the information load per phoneme will probably decrease somewhat (since all the signals won't be equally probable in all contexts), so I'd expect it to take about six of your tone-plus-contour phonemes to convey the equivalent of one English word.
