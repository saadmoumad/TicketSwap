I personally think it would be more accurate to say that Jingulu splits verbs into two classes: a small closed set of *inflecting verbs/auxiliaries*, which carry inflections for cross-referencing, TAM etc.; and a large open set of *uninflecting verbs/coverbs*, which carry the semantics. Most verbal notions are expressed by modifing the appropriate inflecting verb by the appropriate coverb. This structure is not an uncommon one in the region."

In Sweden this is be the natural state of affairs. We have one pronoun for addressing singular people and one to address multiple people, and use them accordingly. The king is usually addressed as &quot;the King&quot;, as &quot;Would the King like to see?&quot;. There used to be a system for polite plural, sometimes used by people trying to be overly formal, almost but not quite like English &quot;thou&quot;.
