If there is something in the original text you have trouble translating, try to find a way to work around it with the grammar you currently have OR invent a new construction to deal with it. In order to do the first one well you need a good awareness of your conlang's grammar. Another danger of this method is relexing the original, especially new vocabulary. Third option: Don't have your conlang be able to translate the challenging characteristic/expression of the text you're translating 'genuinely'.

As far as I can tell, even Elgin remains uncertain on the effect of these approaches to facilitating feminine communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The distinctive characteristics that strike me are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a tonal language&lt;/strong&gt; - This seems to have been very deliberate in the development of Láadan. Does this facilitate feminine thought with particularly more clarity than non-tonal languages?  I am not sure, and I couldn't find any reputable research indicating whether or not that is the case, but I suspect that when the language was being developed by Elgin she did not make it a tonal language by accident.  Since her hypotheses about the implications of Láadan on the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis remain unconfirmed, we probably don't know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The language has emotional context markers.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is presumably meant to aid in the expression of subtle emotional context to avoid ambiguity that leaves a dialogue open to interpretation and reliant on context clues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-d&lt;/em&gt; anger marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-th&lt;/em&gt; pain marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-li&lt;/em&gt; love marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-lan&lt;/em&gt; celebration marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-da&lt;/em&gt; joke marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-di&lt;/em&gt; education marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ya&lt;/em&gt; fear marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The language has many affection words&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, of love.

The traditional ones, however, as set out by Joseph Greenberg, were more about syntax and only a little about morphology, which roots would probably fall under depending on what you want to do with them. Still, we can use the same techniques. We can look at what some real languages do with roots and try to figure out what they don't do, and then do that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roots in most languages are pretty static. They have to be, because they carry the majority of semantic content for a word, so they have to remain recognizable. Some languages, though, have morphology that alters what we would think of as the root in Western languages. In many Semitic languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, roots are combinations of consonants, usually three but sometimes two, and inflect by changing the vowels. In Arabic the consonants &lt;em&gt;k-t-b&lt;/em&gt; are a root that has to do with books and writing. The singular word &quot;book&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kitāb&lt;/em&gt;, the plural &quot;books&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kutub&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;booklet&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kutayyib&lt;/em&gt; with a suffix, &quot;writer&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kātib&lt;/em&gt;, and the verb &quot;to write&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kataba&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some languages also have infixes, which are affixes that are added inside the root instead of being added to the beginning (prefix) or end (suffix). Tagalog, for example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For example, the verb takbo (meaning to run) + the infix um can be made into the word tumakbo, which equates to the simple past tense past tense ran.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(From &lt;a href=&quot;http://talktagalog.com/tagalog-verbs-grammar-prefixes-infixes-suffixes/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://talktagalog.com/tagalog-verbs-grammar-prefixes-infixes-suffixes/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Arabic example, some of the morphology was inflectional, meaning it added some extra meaning to the original root--making a plural, for instance. Some was derivational, meaning we added something to the root that created a new root word--making &quot;books&quot; from &quot;book&quot; is inflectional, but making &quot;book&quot;,  &quot;writer&quot;, and &quot;to write&quot; from the root &lt;em&gt;k-t-b&lt;/em&gt; is derivational. So one possible meaning for &quot;root system&quot; is a system of derivational morphology, and a &quot;unique agglutinative root system&quot; would be a unique agglutinative system of derivational morphology. Speakers tend to regularize morphology over time, but derivational morphology is a little more resistant to it than inflectional: in English, nobody uses &quot;whom&quot; anymore, but we still preserve irregularities like &quot;&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;-vincible&quot; vs. &quot;&lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-beatable&quot; vs. &quot;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;-sexual&quot;. So with derivational morphology, you have a bit more freedom to concoct a weird, wild system without having to simulate a bunch of lazy peasant speakers who can't be bothered to keep using your fancy inflections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hopefully this gives you some ideas for how to create your own system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7" LastActivityDate="2018-02-06T22:51:42.083" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For example &quot;he&quot; is masculine. However &quot;he&quot; could also be neuter, at least in English because it can be used to refer to someone of unknown gender. &quot;it&quot; is clearly neuter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It does make sense though for all nouns and adjectives to have gender. And again, there are clear examples of where 1 gender makes far more sense.

But the possession marker is way simpler than inflecting every possessable noun for the genitive case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I was wondering, should adjectives agree with the noun in all aspects including gender or would a conlang where adjectives have inherent gender and don't have to agree with the noun when it comes to gender be just fine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't want to use the concepts in English except maybe the pronouns, I am just using it as an example language for those concepts partly because that is the only language I know to fluency.

I got a list of what is considered basic English—which are the 800 odd words of a basic English vocabulary. Removed the words that were of no use in the context of my world. Came up with words in the Old Tongue in each of those English words and then added those words that did have a specific context in my world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on that page is an interview where he said this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What language is the Old Tongue based on? Gaelic, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and some additions of my own—bridging material, if you will. Grammar and syntax are a blending of English, German and Chinese, with some influences from a set of African languages, read about long ago and all but the oddities of structure long since forgotten. There are inverted constructions, for example (as in Mordero dagain pas duente cuebiyar!—literally, &quot;Death fear none holds my heart!&quot;) and places where the article is omitted, especially where the word is a title or has gained enough importance to now incorporate the article; the absence of article indicates that it is the important or special meaning of the word that is intended. Though even then, it is not a hard and fast rule; the same inconsistencies of English are incorporated here. I am attempting to create a language which has grown, not one which was made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a complete enough language in terms of grammar and authentic enough for Jordan to use, though lacking in vocabulary.  From these quotes I get the feeling that he created the language well enough at one point that he didn't have to spend hours conlanging to be able to put a few sentences into his novels.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Wheel of Time Companion there was an English-Old Tongue dictionary, which is uploaded on Tor.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tor.com/2016/12/20/the-wheel-of-time-english-to-old-tongue-dictionary/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  At the beginning on the website (not sure if this is also in the book as I don't have it on me) this is written:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While it is reminiscent of Tolkien’s ground-up creation of Elvish languages for The Lord of the Rings, The Old Tongue differs in that Jordan took a top-down approach, creating a dictionary of terms from which some basic suffixes, roots, and usage rules emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't bother scrolling all the way down or counting the words, but it doesn't seem to have much grammar aside from the suffixes and stuff.  Although we don't have access to this, Jordan seems to be implying that the grammar does exist.

It's usually built on predicate logic, and a desire to express any logically-expressible statement unambiguously. No two statements are allowed to mean the same thing, and no statement is allowed to mean two things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Lojban fulfills the literal criteria for what counts as a logical language.

This gives it a few key properties that make it easier for computers to process (though it's still an immensely complicated task to implement). Most of these properties are mathematical, and you can read them on the Wikipedia page. However, what it means in an intuitive way is that no word or word phrase's meaning changes based on words it's not adjacent to. That's a nice property when you're a computer and have a hard time maintaining a sense of context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lojban also has no irregular forms or rule exceptions whatsoever. All words are constructed based on specific properties that are clearly delineated, using roots that are unique and are intended to mesh with each other as-is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that any construction which can be built in a logical form can be written &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;uniquely&lt;/em&gt; in Lojban.

I'm going to cover most of the same ground &lt;a href=&quot;https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/31/35&quot;&gt;as rotaredom's answer&lt;/a&gt;, just in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book notes that there aren't really any greetings in Klingon; they're simply unnecessary. Klingon as a language is somewhat utilitarian in its application, and exchanges typically start with a straightforward statement or query by one party. Saying the Klingon equivalent of &amp;quot;How are you doing?&amp;quot; when you just want to figure out the new ship's departure time is simply wasteful. One answer to your question, then, would be to simply avoid a greeting. The less you talk, the less time you take up. That said, if you want to truly greet someone, you have two options. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Choice 1: Be utilitarian.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This utilitarianism is why all Klingon &amp;quot;greetings&amp;quot; are just introductory phrases. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;nuqneH&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; is the one that seems to be commonly used, as rotaredom said. Its translation is &amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Nuq&amp;quot; itself can be treated as an interrogative sentence on its own, simply meaning &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It can also be used as the start of a sentence, such as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;nuq legh yaS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which means&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does the officer see?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &amp;quot;neH&amp;quot; is used as a form of &amp;quot;to want&amp;quot; (though it also used as an adverbial, to mean &amp;quot;only&amp;quot;). Therefore, we have the compound &amp;quot;nuqneH&amp;quot;, properly an exclamation that stands by itself as a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Choice 2: Use an honorific.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; notes that &amp;quot;neS&amp;quot; is the only honorific suffix in Klingon, used as part of larger words. For instance, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;qaleghneS&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, coming from &amp;quot;qa&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;you&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;legh&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;see&amp;quot;) and &amp;quot;neS&amp;quot;, translates to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am honored to see you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This states a fact, and gets to the point. It &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be used towards a superior, but this is not mandatory, and I don't think it's commonly used. If you wish to open the conversation with an inquiry, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;HIja'neS&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (which includes &amp;quot;HIja&amp;quot;, normally used as an affirmative) can work. Its translation is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do me the honor of telling me [about something].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, use this when asking a superior something, but only if you really want to be respectful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though I have yet to see any of the following used as a greeting, I imagine you could modify them to create some sort of opening remark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;bel&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; is the verb for &amp;quot;to be pleased&amp;quot;, so when greeting someone, you could conceivably say &amp;quot;jIbel&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;I am pleased&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;jI&amp;quot; for first-person). Likewise, &amp;quot;Quch&amp;quot; is the verb for &amp;quot;to be happy&amp;quot;. Using &amp;quot;jIbel&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;jiQuch&amp;quot; to indicate satisfaction upon meeting someone is a possibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;maj&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;quot;Good&amp;quot;) or &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;majQa'&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;quot;Well done&amp;quot;) are exclamations used as praise.

Japanese phonology fits these systems &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well because syllables are basically (C(y))V with the principal exception of syllabic &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; and the secondary one of ‘double consonants’ (まって — matte). Therefore, Japanese needs only around 50 distinct symbols for its syllabary. It made perfect sense to simplify complex Chinese characters to a reduced form carrying just a phonetic information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, languages such as German or English would be terrible choices for inventing a syllabary. Their syllable structures have very little constraints at all; basically anything is possible. Coming up with a syllabary would require many hundreds if not thousands of characters — to the point where it would be simpler and more consistent to create an ideographic writing system instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take for example &lt;em&gt;to write&lt;/em&gt;. In a syllabary, the symbol for &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;I write&lt;/em&gt; would be the same as in &lt;em&gt;right (there)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;you are right.&lt;/em&gt; But then if you take &lt;em&gt;I wrote&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;wrote&lt;/em&gt; would be something completely different (yet with the same symbol as &lt;em&gt;rote memorisation,&lt;/em&gt; I think?). &lt;em&gt;I have written&lt;/em&gt; would use two symbols, neither of which has anything to do with the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an alphabetic or alphasyllabic system, there would at least be some visual resemblence between all those forms allowing for recognition. That’s also why English benefits from its extremely irregular (based on phonetics) spelling: meanings can be recognised based on writing and words with similar meanings are written similarly. Their common root is retained in a common spelling which is not possible in a pure syllabary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A language’s writing system will either have been developed by the language itself or have been copied and adapted from geographically close languages.

In fact, it is likely that Linear A was used to write the pre-Greek language of Crete, and the incoming Greeks adopted this writing system for their own use, but without changing how the system fundamentally works. In doing so, they developed &amp;quot;spelling conventions&amp;quot; to represent sound patterns found in Greek but not in the syllabary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, there are many Greek sounds that are missing in Linear B signs, such as [g], [kh], [gw], [b], [ph], [th], and [l]. To solve this problem, signs for similar sounds are used instead: p-signs are used for [p], [b], and [ph]; k-signs are used for [k], [g], and [kh]; t-signs are used for [t] and [th]; q-signs are used for [kw] and [gw]; and r-signs are used for [r] and [l]. However, while this convention was likely easily understood by ancient Mycenaean scribes, it took modern scholars a lot of theoretical analysis and work, plus comparison with later Greek dialects and reconstructed Mycenaean words to rediscover how this system works&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And more relevantly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another inadequacy stems from the fact that Linear B signs usually represent Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllables, but the syllabic structure of Greek allows initial consonant clusters, ending consonants, and dipthongs. In the case of a syllable with a initial consonant cluster, individual consonants in the cluster are written by a CV sign whose vowel matches the vowel of the syllable. Therefore, for example, the word tri is written as ti-ri, and khrusos as ku-ru-so. In the case of ending consonant, the situation becomes more complicated. Ending consonants such as [l], [m], [n], [r], and [s] are not usually written, whereas other consonants such as [k] and [p] are written in a way similar to initial consonants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So one way to represent consonant clusters in a syllabary is to pick a &amp;quot;dummy vowel&amp;quot; that gets read over when the word is pronounced, as in Linear B, or Japanese katakana when writing foreign words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question doesn't mention just how complex the syllable structure is; if it's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; complex, you can also do what Japanese hiragana does with the ん character and have a single character that represents a syllable-ending consonant. Or something like what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ancientscripts.com/brahmi.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brahmi&lt;/a&gt; does for vowels and nasals, adding strokes and dots to represent them. Maybe if &lt;em&gt;kra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tra&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;pra&lt;/em&gt; are common syllables in your language, you could have a stroke that represents an &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; between the consonant and vowel, and add it to the characters for &lt;em&gt;ka&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ta&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;pa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:27.510" LastActivityDate="2018-02-07T05:26:53.767" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In Khuzdul as well as in Semitic languages, there are usually three radicals in the root; several such roots are mentioned in TI:174 and RS:466: B-R-Z &quot;red&quot;, B-N-D &quot;head&quot;, K-B-L &quot;silver&quot;, N-R-G &quot;black&quot;. An example of a biconsonantal root is Z-N &quot;dark, dim&quot; (RS:466).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baruk Khazâd!&lt;/strong&gt; is said to mean &quot;Axes of the Dwarves!&quot; Baruk is usually taken to be an example of something similar to the Hebrew &quot;construct state&quot;: the state a word is said to be in when it is placed in front of a noun to express a genitival relationship: X Y meaning &quot;X of Y&quot; or &quot;Y's X&quot;. (Compare Hebrew סוס (sûs) &quot;horse&quot;, המלך (hammelekh) &quot;the king&quot;, סוס המלך (sûs hammelekh) &quot;the king's horse, the horse of the king&quot;.) Of course, we cannot be certain that baruk is the normal plural &quot;axes&quot; and not a specialized form meaning &quot;axes of&quot;. It may be significant that all the other attested plurals contain a long vowel: Khazâd &quot;Dwarves&quot;, Rakhâs &quot;Orcs&quot;, tarâg &quot;beards&quot;, shathûr &quot;clouds&quot;, ûl &quot;streams&quot;, dûm &quot;excavations, halls&quot;, bizâr &quot;valleys&quot;. Could the normal plural &quot;axes&quot; be *barûk? Shathûr &quot;clouds&quot; may represent a plural pattern in -a-û-. In Hebrew, the vowels of words in the construct state are often shortened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was it actually based on Hebrew / Semitic languages, or is that simply an impression?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19" LastEditorUserId="73" LastEditDate="2018-10-18T14:38:05.953" LastActivityDate="2018-10-18T14:38:05.953" Title="Is Tolkien's Dwarvish really based on Hebrew?"

English already has some reflexives, providing some amount of disambiguation, Danish goes a little further has a compulsory reflexive/non-reflexive distinction in 3rd person possessives, and while the specific example you mentioned doesn't work well in translation, a similarly problematic sentence &quot;Adam sent James his essay&quot; can be easily somewhat disambiguated with this system:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; sendte James&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; stil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; sendte James&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j(/k)&lt;/sub&gt; stil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is possible for reflexive systems to be significantly more broad than this, rather than just referring to antecedents in the same clause, even if it's omitted via some other rule, e.g. in &lt;em&gt;&quot;Jonh saw Adam and shot &lt;strong&gt;himself&lt;/strong&gt; in the foot&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, where there is no overt reference to John in the second clause, because it's been omitted due to subject coreference (such deletion rules, when constraints are put on them is actually another way of reducing ambiguity, I have relatively recently written &lt;a href=&quot;http://aveneca.com/cbb/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;amp;p=272613#p272613&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;a rather long forum post&lt;/a&gt; on this which goes into much more detail about them), it's possible to have &quot;&lt;strong&gt;long-distance reflexives&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; which take antecedents outside of the clause. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Mandarin, the reflexive &lt;em&gt;ziji&lt;/em&gt; can refer to both local and non-local antecedents in some cases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Zhangsan renwei Lisi kan-bu-qi ziji&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;Zhangsan think Lisi look-not-up REFL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks Lisi&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; looks down on self&lt;sub&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i/j&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain things block this though, for example shifts in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Zhangsan renwei wo zhidao Wangwu xihuan ziji&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;Zhangsan think I know Wangwu like REFL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; know Wangwu&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; likes self&lt;sub&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*i/*j/k&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Igbo, in complements of communication, entities that are coreferential with the source of information are marked by what is known as &quot;&lt;strong&gt;logophoric pronouns&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;ọ́  sị̀rị̀ nà   ọ́  byàrà&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;he said that he came&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; came&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;ọ́  sị̀rị̀ nà   yá  byàrà&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;he said that LOG came&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; came&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gokana also has such a system, though the marking is on the verb, though the constraints on what can be coreferential are quite free:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ aè dɔ&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;he said he fell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; fell&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ aè dɔ-ɛ&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;he said he fell-LOG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; fell&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ oò div-èè e&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;he said you hit-LOG him&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that you hit him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ oò ziv-èè a gĩ́ã́&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;he said you stole-LOG his yams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that you stole his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; yams&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logophoricity&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The wikipedia article on logophoricity&lt;/a&gt; goes into more depth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to have two different reflexives, requiring respectively local and non-local antecedents. Danish has a rather limited case of this in bare complements to perception verbs, where the two reflexives &lt;em&gt;sig&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sig selv&lt;/em&gt; which are usually either only different in level of emphasis or in complementary distribution, respectively require non-local and local antecedents:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Holger hørte Peter tale om sig.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Holger hørte Peter tale om sig selv.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Holger hørte Peter tale om ham.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;4th Person systems&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; such as seen Eskimo languages are rather similar, though more general as they are used in all subordinate clauses are also another type of reflexive-like construction (the &quot;fourth&quot; person is often labeled 3R) and they are also used intraclausally in possessive marking. In all of these cases they mark that a participant or possessor is coreferential with the subject of the main clause (which is defined in terms of S/A despite the case marking being ergative). An example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lB-Izi_GRc15obQHG3fUni-_T6ZHifqJ/view&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Siberian Yupik&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;esghaghyagu quyaaq&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;see:CNSQ:3s&amp;gt;3s happy:IND.3s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;esghaghyamigu quyaaq&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;see:CNSQ:3Rs&amp;gt;3s happy:IND.3s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;esghaghyatni quyaaq&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;see:CNSQ:3s&amp;gt;3Rs happy:IND.3s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; was happy&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to all these various reflexive constructions, &lt;strong&gt;switch reference&lt;/strong&gt;, the overt marking of whether the &quot;subject&quot; is either the same or different, either between two coordinate clauses, or a subordinate and main clause can also resolve some ambiguity. Take for example this pair of sentences from Hua:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;ebgi-Ø-na korihie&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;hit-SAME-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ran away&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;ebgi-ga-na korihie&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;hit-3sg.DIFF-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;&quot;he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; ran away&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Switch reference can only deal with one set of coreference though what exactly is tracked varies. In some languages, it is specifically the actor that is tracked, while others may track the topic or some other pragmatically prominent NP, or may even differ in what is tracked in the controlling clause as opposed to the clause recieving the marking. Additionally the marking may occasionally also be sensitive to changes in things like time, place, discourse coherency and/or reality status, and as a result, switch reference may fulfill may other roles than simply dealing with ambiguity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2hgQLVtMsqZMWt2YlZFTHpKR0E&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt;, particularly chapters 5 and 6, goes into quite a bit of detail about the highly varied and interesting usage of switch-ref in Papua New Guinean languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastEditorUserId="145" LastEditDate="2018-02-14T19:26:43.763" LastActivityDate="2018-02-14T19:26:43.763" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

As such, a purely logographic system cannot really deal with natural languages to their full extent, and therefore pick up &quot;impurities&quot;, not just out of convenience, but out of necessity, since without them they are generally at best mnemonic aids and not a full (or almost full) representation of the spoken language. If you want a pure logographic system to be realistically viable for your conlang, going the oligomorphemic route, like Toki Pona, is probably the most reasonable, as the low number of morphemes reduces the strain of learning a large number of symbols, as well as the issue of coming up with new ones for new or rarely written-about concepts, since morphemes are a closed class, and the necessarily relatively general meaning of these morphemes means that it would likely be relatively straightforward to represent the majority of them with mostly intuitive iconography.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastActivityDate="2018-02-07T13:40:44.923" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Modern computers are good enough approximations for most purposes, but they are in reality just very large finite state machines. A true Turing machine requires &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; storage space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The infinite storage space of the Turing machine model is mirrored in the (computationally equivalent) lambda calculus by the capacity to define an infinite number of arbitrarily-named variables. This suggests a natural connection to human languages: the potentially-infinite set of variables in lambda calculus corresponds to the set of &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; in a human language, while human grammars correspond to the reduction rules of lambda calculus. Transferring that back to the Turing machine model, the infinite storage tape of a Turing machine corresponds to the potential vocabulary of a human language, while the state transition rules correspond to a grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the first thing you need to make a human language &quot;Turing complete&quot;--capable of referring to or describing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that can be referred to or described--is an infinite vocabulary! That's clearly impossible, but like real computers approximate Turing machines, we can approximate a &quot;Turing complete conlang&quot; simply by ensuring there is some way to create new lexical items--either strictly by as-needed de-novo coinage, or oligosynthesis, or whatever other word-formation techniques you like--and then abstract away from the vocabulary and looking at the &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; for how that vocabulary is used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continuing the analogy, the fact that there are two such radically different formulations for computation that are nevertheless provably identical in expressive power (the lambda calculus and Turing machine--and, in fact, even more different formalisms than that, like the SKI combinator calculus, NAND machines and the One Instruction Set Computer, etc.) suggests that there may not be any &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; simplest set of grammar constructs that make an abstract language &quot;complete&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Empirically, however, if you put stock in David Gil's work on so-called IMA (Isolating-Monocategorial-Associative) language, the only necessary &lt;em&gt;and sufficient&lt;/em&gt; requirement for effective human communication (or as he puts it, enough grammar &quot;to sail a boat&quot;) is the existence of a generic &quot;association operator&quot;--a way to say &quot;the things represented by these two sub-phrases are related somehow&quot;--and literally everything else can be handled by pragmatics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you need the ability to introduce whatever words you find that you need in a given situation, and you need at least one operator that can specify arbitrary relations between things (e.g., the generic English preposition &quot;of&quot;)--which could have a surface expression as simple as juxtaposition.

The possibility of the Voynich manuscript being a constructed language was brought to his attention by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Friedman&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;William Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on the manuscript. Friedman confided to Tiltman, after decades of work on it, that he thought the writing could be a form of &amp;quot;synthetic universal language&amp;quot;, and so the cryptographer expanded his investigation in that direction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/tech-journals/assets/files/voynich-manuscript-mysterious.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;writing a paper on the theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic premise behind a &amp;quot;synthetic universal language&amp;quot; is to use characters to represent certain logical ideas; by chaining together letters, you can create &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; that describe more complicated principles. By adding the appropriate prefixes and suffixes, characters can be quite powerful. Tiltman noticed that some of the patterns in the words fit this type of design. However, the evidence for this sort of construction was not strong enough, and Tiltman's analysis of the frequency of the occurrence of certain letters did not support Friedman's hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tiltman also traced the historical origin of a &amp;quot;universal language&amp;quot;, to determine if such an idea had been bounced around early enough. However, this proved difficult, and Tiltman found no concrete examples prior to the mid-17th century. This is two centuries after the Voynich manuscript was written - sometime in the 15th century - and so &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the manuscript was indeed written in a universal language, it would predate these universal languages by two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tiltman noted&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was clear that the productions of these two men [Wilkins and Dalgarno, two early proponents of universal languages] were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution. When I was&#xA;attempting to trace back the idea of universal language, I came upon a printed book entitled The Universal Character by Cave Beck, London 1657 (also printed in French in the same year). Cave Beck was one of the original members of the British Royal Society and his system was certainly a cumbersome mixture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beck's writing claims that the idea of a universal language goes back to the 16th century, but this still places it many years after the manuscript's origin.  The idea of synthetic universal languages, though perhaps relatively widespread in the 17th century, simply was unknown in the 15th. This was a strike against Friedman's theory. If the Voynich manuscript was a synthetic universal language, it would have borne no relation - in time of conception of structure - to later examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The universal language route is of course not the only possibility; constructed languages can take many forms. However, it was possible the most promising option, and research into it went nowhere. Friedman's claim remains unsupported, and, to my knowledge, no further academic analyses have been done.

In general, it is rather easy to come up with a feature that does not seem to occur in natural languages: simply take a feature every language appears to possess (for example: phonemes, verbs, hierarchical syntax that can be described with syntax trees, a very large amount of words) and reject it. Then see what you can do with the language. This leads to so-called &lt;em&gt;Engelangs&lt;/em&gt;, short for “Engineered Languages”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, one can from the ground up decide to build structure from a different “philosophy”, e.g. build on predicate logic, or stacks (the CS concept), or… well, whatever you can think of that can organize information, really. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make an example, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ithkuil.net/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ithkuil&lt;/a&gt;. Ithkuil does not strive to be a naturalistic language. Instead, its goal is to allow for unambiguity. Among the things it does to provide that are a range of grammatical inflections not found in any natural language - too many to list, but one example I can make is its case system. In most natural languages, case is something of a helper to syntax. Case marks words for their syntactic roles and thus helps create the structure necessary to understand a sentence. In Ithkuil however, case marks &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;. The sentence “I hit you” in ithkuil would require different cases for “I” and “you” depending on whether e.g. I was a volitional actor, or whether the hitting was an unavoidable circumstance, or an accident, or mediated by someone else… While traces of such systems are found in natural language, none get even close to the extreme of Ithkuil. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, an interesting anecdote is the &lt;em&gt;Conlang Trigger System&lt;/em&gt;, a novel way of structuring languages employed in &lt;em&gt;naturalistic&lt;/em&gt; conlangs (i.e. ones striving to be mistakable for natural languages). The trigger system developed from misunderstandings of the way certain Austronesian languages (such as Tagalog) work.

Yes, a sudden collapse of the tone system in a Chinese language, or any other language with a high functional load on tonal contrasts would be rather challenging to deal with, but so would any sudden collapse of significant scope, whereas a slow collapse, where contrasts are lost slowly, one after one, in some environments before others gives plenty of time to resolve any disasterous mass ambiguity with innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have tried looking around for examples of tone loss, and this seems to be the pattern I have been able to find. The Oto-Manguean languages with fewer tonal contrast that the reconstructed protolanguages seem to simply come from mergers of tones, either consistently or only in some environments (e.g. unstressed syllables) though the data is not quite clear&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-01.sil.org/acpub/repository/16416.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classical Chinese had 8 tonal categories divisible into &lt;em&gt;yin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;yang&lt;/em&gt; registers occuring respectively after voiced and unvoiced consonants, and into four different categories, &lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;shang&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;qu&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ru&lt;/em&gt;(checked syllables). While some modern lects such as Songjiang maintain all of these as seperate categories (Songjiang also retains contrastive onset voicing), others collapse the system in various ways. Beijing Mandarin collapses the &lt;em&gt;yin/yang&lt;/em&gt; distinction of the &lt;em&gt;shang&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;qu&lt;/em&gt; tones and merges &lt;em&gt;ru&lt;/em&gt; into the other tones, while the relatively nearby Tianjin Mandarin keeps &lt;em&gt;yin shang&lt;/em&gt; seperate, while merging &lt;em&gt;yang shang&lt;/em&gt; with other tones. Along similar lines the different Chinese lects have radically different distinction-dimininshing sandhi processes, from the well-known relatively limited &lt;code&gt;214 &amp;gt; 35 / _214&lt;/code&gt; rule of Beijing Mandarin to the complete loss of surface realisation of all but one dominant lexical tone in Northern Wu variants such as Shanghainese. Again, there does not seem to be any phonological compensatory measures associated with any of these losses of contrasts.&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=15iz7n8460TEoqAjh9uyld33VadySCUY_&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tonoexodus that isn't a simple collapse seems to be hard to find, though the Danish glottal suprasegmental feature &lt;em&gt;stød&lt;/em&gt; likely originates in a pitch accent system (note that some dialects have pitch-accent and some collapse the distinction entirely), and it seems reasonable to expect that other collapses of a two-way tone system to a phonation system could be found. As for other things, the largely autosegmental nature of tone means that it doesn't leave much room for other segmental changes, however there seem to be a few cases of such influences, primarily on consonant voicing discussed in sections 2.6 and 2.7 of Yip's &lt;em&gt;Tone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rxWSzQz-V8sJExiDfc3lW6sl3whCXWnV&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; and references therein, though she notes that it has been argued by Thurgood that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; such alternations are a product of phonation types (which may then coincidentally be associated with tone) influencing voicing rather than tone itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion it seems that the most likely process of tonoexodus is simply a slow gradual loss of contrasts in an increasing number of environments, with the associated lexical replacement/innovation that comes with language change, and a tone system evolving into something else rather than just being lost entirely is likely to become a phonation system, possibly with a minor influence on consonant voicing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastActivityDate="2018-02-08T10:49:20.420" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There are new reports about changes to the language (and proposals to do so).

For the most part, excluding specific major developments like the Great Morphological Revolution of 1989, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loglan.org/what-is-loglan.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the structure has stayed the same&lt;/a&gt;, but grammar and vocabulary continue to grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the total number of speakers, we have little to no data. My impression is that since the split, Lojban has become more popular than Loglan. The Lojban community is largely Internet-based, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/lojbanmo.html#AEN536&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;perhaps 20-200 people&lt;/a&gt; use it in some non-negligible capacity. Loglan's userbase is probably smaller than that, although I don't know how small. It's clearly non-zero, but not by much - perhaps 10 or 20 people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question of whether Loglan is dead or alive rests in part on how you define a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_language&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;dead language&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think anybody has ever learned Loglan or Lojban as a native language; you could therefore argue that it was never alive in the first place. So I suppose the best answer to your questions is that yes, Loglan is still being used and changed, but it's not &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot; in the sense of most languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Loglan Institute &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loglan.org/what-is-loglan.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;considers Loglan to be alive&lt;/a&gt; because of the constant grammar/vocabulary changes; they define a dead language as one that isn't evolving.

I just want to add more on why people create them, which should illuminate why people learn them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You say you understand that people create conlangs for the &quot;world of a book or game.&quot;  This is the case, but there are many other types of conlangs. Conlangs can be created as a linguistic experiment, an attempt for people to speak more logically, as a language intended to become universally accepted (arguably the most famous conlang, Esperanto, is for this purpose).  They can be created to add spice or realism to a world, like Dothraki, Klingon, Quenya; they can be just for fun, or a secret language to speak with your friends.  You can even make a language for only women, so they can communicate on an equal footing with men.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then why do people learn conlangs?  Well, it depends what type it is.  Maybe you just want to because you can--or maybe you genuinely believe that it is the only logical way to communicate.  Or maybe you're a huge fan of Star Trek and you want to speak klingon.  Or maybe you just want to be able to communicate with your siblings without your parents understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about conlangs is that you don't need to care about them unless you're interested.

When linguists begin working with a language for which no grammar or dictionary is available, they ordinarily start with a set of roughly 100 very basic words made up of items like “eat” and “sleep” and “food.” I followed that practice, and began by constructing a core vocabulary of those basic words; when I had those done I began adding additional roots that I felt were needed. &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes I can explain to some extent how I chose a particular shape for one of those words; much of the time I can’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example… I can explain that I chose “oódóo” for “bridge” because when pronounced its tune makes the shape of a humpback bridge. I can explain that I chose “rul” for “cat” because the purring of a cat sounds to me like “rulrulrulrul…” But the choice of “ana” for “food” and “ina” for “sleep” was arbitrary; &lt;strong&gt;I have no explanation for those choices other than that I tried to give them a shape that could easily be combined with other morphemes.&lt;/strong&gt; For any constructed language that isn’t based on some existing language, the hardest part will always be putting together the inventory of roots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfwa.org/members/elgin/LaadanLessons/LaadanVocab0306.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;update to the Láadan dictionary&lt;/a&gt; shows that not all of the words were created by Suzette Haden Elgin (the creator of Láadan) but all that are not roots in and of themselves--roots which seem to have been created rather arbitrarily--can be figured out from these roots.  For example, in the dictionary I linked, the word for beaver is &amp;quot;eduthemid.&amp;quot;  This contains the rood for animal, &amp;quot;mid,&amp;quot; and some other root, I presume &amp;quot;eduth.&amp;quot;  I do't know what this means, but it was constructed in this way so that someone who knew these roots but did not know the word could discern that it means beaver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original creator of Láadan made a couple of arbitrary roots that could then become a lexicon through a logical process of morphology, with help from multiple other people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:27.510" LastActivityDate="2018-02-08T19:24:16.553" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I will try to explain why i started to learn a constructed language called lojban.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Better Meaning extraction for human-computer interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to build AI's and talk to them like real humans. The problem i'm facing is how to convert my English &lt;strong&gt;from speech&lt;/strong&gt; to - &lt;strong&gt;text form&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;then into meaning&lt;/strong&gt; - so that the computer can take different programmatic actions depending on that meaning.. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And i want to do this with complex thoughts - not &quot;Cortana close the light&quot; type of commands. That is easy to do it in English already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;English and most other languages is not well suited for easy parsing of meaning. The amount of ambiguity in any non trivial phrase is enormous. Exponential complexity is a big problem. We humans solve it by putting things into context - and also trough lot's and lot's of experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And even so  - we sometimes misunderstand each other.. Keep in mind that we are very smart. Computers are kind of dumb at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building this context and this experience in an AI is almost an inapproachable task. Building the context is even a bigger problem then parsing the relations between words. It's called an AI hard problem. Only big companies like Google and Microsoft have the resources to approach a problem of this size. Cortana is mostly pre-scripted answers at this point (feb 2018). Is not the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now if you have a constructed language like lojban - you have at least 2 big benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the speech to text conversion happens very easily - because lojban has no phonetic ambiguity. Words are typed the way they are pronounced. Is a 1 to 1 mapping. I don't need to understand what you meant in order to know for certain what you said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the grammar is very congruent / precise - and is said to have zero exceptions - this makes parsing and meaning extraction easier by orders of magnitude. Ambiguity is still an issue - but a manageable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In English - we extract meaning and solve ambiguity by relying mostly on statistics. We garter billions of phrases - and based on that we &lt;strong&gt;infer&lt;/strong&gt; what is &lt;strong&gt;the most probable meaning of a phrase&lt;/strong&gt;. We do this with models based on neural networks - that are black boxes for the most part. Point is - grammar rules are not that useful in English. When you debug your program - you can't clearly see why a certain chunk of text was summarized to a certain phrase. You can use your human intuition - and you can agree or disagree with the summary - but if you disagree - you can't easily inspect the decision that the computer took at each step. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntF5cFZq1PA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Introduction to the parsing problem is a good place to start.&lt;/a&gt; The production systems are more advanced then this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In lojban, by contrast things are simpler: there are only verbs(selbri) and nouns(sumti) - actually is more like - &lt;strong&gt;functions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;arguments to those functions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can heavily rely on rules - and that is enough to get the meaning out with a very high accuracy. And in principle is scalable  .. phrases, paragraphs, pages .. hole speeches, hole books, the entire Wikipedia - a web of meaning.. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is why i'm interested in it. A web of meaning - as opposed to a web of data. Right now computers can see &lt;strong&gt;the data&lt;/strong&gt; - but they can't see &lt;strong&gt;the meaning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Answer to questions the way an Expert would do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another even more interesting use-case for a constructed language is it's ability to provide a sufficient and universal representation of knowledge that is easy to query by computers. We are interested in getting useful answers from big amounts of unstructured data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google is trying to do this for ages. You still get bad results even for easy to answer questions. The way an expert answers a question - is different from google. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We need more of that expert answer. This is almost always true for complex questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You want the answer alone&lt;/strong&gt; not 10's of articles that might or might not contain the answer - articles that you need to read yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this situation is primarily because 99.9% of human knowledge is represented as text - mostly in English - which is very hard to parse, and query in a meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So one way to solve this - is to have all this knowledge in a system that is easy to query by design. And this is what constructed languages can potentially offer. And i don't mean sql databases - is way better - is in the computation itself. The way we humans do it internally - the computers will be able to do it as well. We are still a far cry form that - but i think this direction is promising..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. On a personal level. Language might affect the way you think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is best express by watching an awesome movie like Arrival. or by reading articles &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/does-language-i-speak-influence-way-i-think&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If lojban were to be our default language instead of English - i think our entire civilization we would have been centuries more advanced that we are now - not just technologically - but in general. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm just learning this stuff myself. But hopefully this allows you to see that there are much more practical applications - with very serious consequences then just: &quot;you look more smart in front of your friends&quot; - that is not something would convince me to get trough the struggle of learning a new language. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are people that don't struggle that much - for them the other reasons might make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="194" LastActivityDate="2018-02-08T22:17:31.933" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

[kw] relaxes into [hw]; [dr] &gt; [ðr] &gt; [r]; as the final syllable weakens, the accent shifts towards the word head; as the accent shifts towards the word head, medial long vowels become shortened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sit back in astoundment how you've just discovered several sound change rules!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't like that progression, try another one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kind of a simplistic exercise, but it's a good method to start. Eventually, other rules you discover are going to intersect and sometimes abrogate another law. Sometimes two parallel dialects run along slightly different tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes dialects are &quot;behind the times&quot; when compared to others, and this will launch you into the wonder world of diachronics. The study of when sound changes occur in a particular place and in what order the changes happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And of course, you're considering a whole family tree, so you're going to need to do this exercise multiple times. You might find that two or three daughter lineages kind of align in certain ways. For example, *cwadrut yields hawar in language A and qewarro in language B and kawrs in language C but shwuntz in language D and shhwandaras in language E.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you examine other words, you notice that ancestral [k-] remains [k] or becomes [h] (both palatal sounds) in several languages, all of which are at the eastern end of this proto language's continuum; while most of the languages where ancestral [k-] has become [ʃ] are all in the west.

For example, the hypothetical spirantization of [b] to [v] intervocalically could be notated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;b &gt; v / V__V&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This rule indicates that b becomes v when surrounded by a vowel (V) on each side. The __ indicates a &quot;placeholder&quot; for where the original sound was and where the new sound goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some other common notations are # for word boundaries and [+feature] or [-feature] to indicate the presence or lack of a certain feature respectively. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final-obstruent_devoicing&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;final-obstruent devoicing&lt;/a&gt; in e.g. Russian could be&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[+stop][+voiced] &gt; [-voiced] / __#&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where the __# means that the stop in question (__) is at the end of a word (#).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for b), the best way to get an idea for what kinds of things generally happen in languages is honestly probably just by reading about lots of different languages and seeing what tends to happen. Some of the most common general processes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, probably one of the most common sound changes, in which a &quot;softer&quot; sound becomes a &quot;louder&quot; sound. (There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonority_hierarchy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;some general rules&lt;/a&gt; that determine what this actually means, although it can vary between languages). A few examples are intervocalic flapping in many English dialects (/bɛtər/ → [bɛɾɚ]) and the pronunciation of /b, d, g/ as fricatives or approximants, roughly [β, ð, ɣ], in most contexts in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(phonology)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assimilation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another frequent sound change. This occurs when features of a given phoneme are influenced by the phonemes around it. For example, in English and Spanish, /n/ becomes [m] before bilabials and [ŋ] before velars (e.g. &amp;lt;rainbow&gt; [ɹ̠ʷej&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt;bow], &amp;lt;concordar&gt; [ko&lt;strong&gt;ŋ&lt;/strong&gt;koɾðaɾ]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar ideas are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(linguistics)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;umlaut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_harmony&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vowel harmony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which vowels change depending on other vowels in the word. Remnants of Germanic umlaut can be seen in English, e.g. foot/feet, and vowel harmony is prominent in e.g. Turkish, where all of the vowels in a word have to harmonize (for the most part) so that affixes have several different forms (for example, the genitive suffix is [in] after front unrounded vowels, [ɯn] after back unrounded vowels, [yn] after front rounded vowels, and [un] after back rounded vowels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there are general patterns, it's also important to note that some sound changes seem completely illogical and random, and just... sort of happen. The most infamous examples are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruki_sound_law&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ruki rule&lt;/a&gt;, where [s] became [ʃ] but only after [r, w, k, j] (?), and strangest of all, Proto-Indo-European *dw to Armenian erk (???).

Other contrasts than visibility are possible, for example in Fore(TNG, Eastern Higlands Province PNG), which has a 5-way speaker/listener/proximal/medial/distal system, with proximal and distal further exhibiting a 3-way same level/above/below vertical relationship, for a total of 9 different demonstratives&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2hgQLVtMsqZeXVBMUpWX3Q4ckE&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than overlaying various such contrasts on a system there is also the possibility of instead having a large set of what may be called &quot;positional stems&quot;, whith relatively specific semantics such as &quot;up above&quot;, &quot;on the beach&quot; or &quot;towards the Siberian mainland&quot; which can then either be used as or derived into demonstratives. The various Yup'ik languages(Eskaleut, Bering Sea area) are an example of languages with a lot of these, and using various specialised and general nominal morphology allows forming demonstrative pronouns and adverbs with meanings such as &quot;the ones up there&quot; or &quot;from the two entities upstairs/on the mountain&quot;, though I think there is a fair bit of variation in the actual meaning of the different stems between the different lects and langs.

It is almost not used in international context, like on the Internet (&quot;knuflo&quot; esperanto gives less than 12 results with Google), outside of groups that are community specific. Outside of these groups, the word is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knuflo is like hugging, but longer, with more parts of the body. It is like cuddling, but it is hard to describe. Users say you have to receive a &lt;em&gt;knuflo&lt;/em&gt; to understand it, and you have to experience it to understand why the word is needed in the language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here, you have three factors.

When people speak mainly within their own community, slang appear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt; factor: Young people coin new words for the &lt;strong&gt;new environment&lt;/strong&gt;, and for &lt;strong&gt;concepts that are felt important for the social group&lt;/strong&gt;.

There is an &lt;strong&gt;event-slang&lt;/strong&gt;, with words such as &quot;gufujo&quot;, &quot;stelo (mono)&quot;, etc. Esperanto events are often attended by people from neighboring countries. This way local slang is shared among people of different countries and age. Because of this, you can sometimes hear &quot;knuflo&quot; in French-speaking Belgium and Germany (near the Netherlands). The word is also shared in huge international youth events like JES and IJK, where a consequent number of participants come from the knuflo-region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt; factor: &quot;knuflo&quot; comes directly from the Dutch verb &quot;knuffelen&quot;.

Not only does this show that the conlang community has a strong Eurocentric bias, I think it shows it has a massive &lt;strong&gt;Anglocentric&lt;/strong&gt; bias! Because it is English which is so strongly tense prominent. Most other current European languages also mark aspect or modality, but English doesn't even have a full aspect inflectional system, just the continuous &lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;. Some European languages arguably don't even have tense, such as Koine Greek (for the last decade this has been a huge debate among Biblical scholars.) And evidentiality, which is present all around the world, including some European languages (some Slavic) was only present from what I could see in a single conlang! &lt;strong&gt;If Anglocentric bias were not a factor I would expect to see conlangs with a much broader distribution of inflected TAME categories, but as it is, 80+% have tense&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe alongside aspect or modality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, many languages had muddled/fusional verb paradigms. You've probably seen them before: they include tense, aspect, the perfect, mood, utterance type (question or command), all in one table, each affix marking some combination of these semantic categories, but the combinations aren't very visible when they're listed one-dimensionally. Where are the agglutinative conlangs? Don't forget that European languages includes Turkish and several Uralic languages! (I found one conlang which is agglutinative in its verbal morphology: &lt;a href=&quot;http://conlang.wikia.com/wiki/Einodo#Verbs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Einodo&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, often even when I judged a language to have aspect or modality it was because they had something called a &quot;conditional&quot; or a &quot;subjunctive&quot;, rather than a core division between the prototypical categories: realis/irrealis, or perfective/imperfective. Now maybe some of those languages do actually have what should be analysed as the simple core categories, but they have been given alternate names by those describing them in Wikipedia. This reflects the Eurocentric and Anglocentric bias which is a big problem in descriptive linguistics.

This occurs when a string that is an affix also occurs within a root word. For example, the suffix &lt;em&gt;-em&lt;/em&gt; means &quot;a tendency/propensity for...&quot;, deriving words like &lt;em&gt;kompatema&lt;/em&gt; &quot;charitable&quot; and &lt;em&gt;kompatemo&lt;/em&gt; &quot;charity/mercifulness&quot; from &lt;em&gt;kompato&lt;/em&gt; &quot;compasson, pity&quot;.

Nouns, for example, can be declined to show cases, which tell the speaker things about what they are doing.  Verbs can be used to show who the subject is, and the tense and mood and stuff.  For example, in English we would say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The boy loves the girl&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in Latin (I don't know any other languages with cases well enough for this answer) we would say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Puer puellam amat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of info here: the first word (&lt;strong&gt;puer&lt;/strong&gt;), meaning &quot;boy&quot; is in the nominative case, meaning it is the subject of the sentence.  &lt;strong&gt;Puellam,&lt;/strong&gt; girl, is in the accusative, meaning it is the direct object.  In addition, the verb, &lt;strong&gt;amat,&lt;/strong&gt; has the 3rd person singular present indicative ending &lt;strong&gt;-t.&lt;/strong&gt;  In this case this isn't enough to tell us who the subject is, as both the nouns are 3rd person singular, but coupled with the nominative, we can easily figure out who is loving whom.  Therefore, the same thing can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Puellam amat puer&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Amat puer puellam&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or any other combination you'd like, and the listeners or readers would understand because of the cases of the nouns.

Finnish has 15, Hungarian has 18; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a whole bunch of cases that appear, all to free up the word order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of these, many prepositions can be omitted entirely, verbs can use inflections to show the subject and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adjectives that modify nouns must agree in case with the nouns--so a reader can easily infer their meaning from what case they are in.  Because of these, word order having any grammatical function is unnecessary and redundant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As another example, my own conlang Simean has four cases.  Here is a sentence with all of them:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Nuler loyile shuir edeï sefmou.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Translated, this is: &quot;The soldier (Nominative) is giving the king (Dative) of the land (Genitive) a book (Accusative).&quot;  The verb, &lt;strong&gt;loyile,&lt;/strong&gt; is the stem &lt;strong&gt;loy-&lt;/strong&gt; plus the imperfect affix &lt;strong&gt;-i-&lt;/strong&gt; plus the third person singular &lt;strong&gt;-le.&lt;/strong&gt;  If instead, we wanted to say &quot;I am giving the king of the land a book,&quot; we could take out sefmou, soldier, and we wouldn't have to add in the word for I because of the verb inflection.  Instead, the subject could be expressed through the verb.

This is often explained in simple terms using the W questions: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;ho&lt;/em&gt; is doing something, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;hat&lt;/em&gt; are they doing, &lt;em&gt;ho&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are they doing it, &lt;em&gt;to &lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;hom&lt;/em&gt; are they doing it, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;hen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; are they doing it, etc. In grammatical terms, these can be labelled as subject, verb, adverbs, objects, adverbials and more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some languages, quite a few categories are distinguishable &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; just by their ending. For example in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, singular nouns are marked with terminal &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt;, adjectives end in &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt; and conjugated verbs usually in &lt;em&gt;-[vowel]s&lt;/em&gt;. Likewise, a general knowledge of the conjugation tables of Finnish often allows a quick and dirty rough estimate whether a word happens to a noun or adjective or a verb form. English is generally terrible at this distinction with a number of words being written and pronounced the same regardless of the category (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, what is mentioned in the paragraph above only accounts for the word type; if a sentence has two nouns we may not immediately be able to distinguish between the subject noun and the object noun without additional information. Thus, languages generally use one of two methods to clarify what exactly is meant:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information is encoded in word order. This is often the rule for languages with rather low levels of inflection such as English or Chinese. In English, the following two sentences are different because of the different subject and object functions even though all the words are the same:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The man bites the dog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The dog bites the man.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information is encoded in inflection, prepositions, participles, suffixes and the like. While very likely all languages make use of this scheme partially, some do to a much larger extent than English; for example German or Finnish. In German and Finnish, the following two sentences with the same words but different order mean &lt;em&gt;the same:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Der Mann beißt den Hund.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Mies puree koiraa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Den Hund beißt der Mann.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Koiraa puree mies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I’m not sure if the second Finnish example is strictly allowed in that way; however, my Finnish course includes a  similar precedence of an OVS sentence).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By marking the nouns according to case — and thus, according to their grammatic function — we have one clear subject (the agent, the man; nominative case in both examples) and one clear object (the patient, the dog; accusative or partitive case). Once the relation between the two is established like this, one is typically free to move the components around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than using declension by case, modifiers can be placed around a word. In Japanese, that would be the particles が, は, を, に, へ and others. The word or phrase that precedes the particle が is understood to be the subject of a sentence, whatever precedes を is an object. In theory, this would allow the parts suffixed in that way to be moved around as seen fit. (Whether Japanese actually does that I do not know as my knowledge of it is still too basic.) Other options of the same general flavour include prepositions: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; the house&lt;/em&gt; shows that the house is used to denote location and is not an agent or a patient of the sentence. Even in the otherwise relatively strict word order of English, adverbials such as that can be moved around to a certain degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Languages that allow a more or less free word order will not rely on word order to assign syntactical roles. Instead, markers or modifiers of certain types will likely be used; cases and declension being a rather common choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="116" LastActivityDate="2018-02-15T09:27:21.290" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

He isn't 100% consequent, but this adds a lot of regularity to his design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do other Romance-based conlangs deal with the principal parts?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="142" LastEditorUserId="113" LastEditDate="2018-02-17T00:40:49.737" LastActivityDate="2018-03-06T19:13:19.990" Title="How do Romance-based naturalistic conlangs deal with the different principal parts of a verb?"

It is common for languages to have more than one of these, and to my knowledge all free word order natural languages have either case or verbal agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Case refers to grammatical markers attached to nouns which indicate the noun's role in the sentence. Some languages have a very large number of cases, but in general you can expect such a language to have at least two cases: nominative and accusative, or ergative and absolutive. Here is an example from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%202_0.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Walmajarri&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parri-ngu  pa   manga-Ø   nyanya&#xA;boy-subj   AUX  girl-obj  saw&#xA;'The boy saw the girl.'&#xA;&#xA;parri-Ø  pa   nyanya  manga-ngu&#xA;boy-obj  AUX  saw     girl-subj&#xA;'The girl saw the boy.'&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Walmajarri &lt;code&gt;ngu&lt;/code&gt; is the ergative case marker. Walmajarri has a null absolutive case marker, shown here as &lt;code&gt;Ø&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second strategy is agreement, where markers are attached to the verb to give information about the subject and object. Depending on the language, these markers might indicate the person, number, or gender of each noun. Here's an example, again from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%201_0.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Walmajarri&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nayili  nya-ka-kyaka-ji-pila&#xA;north   see-IRR-REDUP-1sgO-3dlS&#xA;'You two watch out for me in the north.'&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here the verb has two suffixes (actually clitics), &lt;code&gt;-ji&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-pila&lt;/code&gt;, which mean a 1st person singular object, and a 3rd person dual subject. While it is most common for these verbal agreement markers to be attached to the verbs, in some languages they are attached to other elements in the sentence. In Walmajarri the most common sentence form actually has these markers attaching to a modal auxiliary:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngayirta  ma-rnalu     majurra  kang-ka-rla&#xA;NEG       AUX-1plincS  matches  carry-IRR-PAST&#xA;'We didn't take matches.'&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;ma&lt;/code&gt; is the unmarked modal auxiliary, to which &lt;code&gt;-rnalu&lt;/code&gt; is attached, the marker for a 1st person plural inclusive subject. Matches is a third person singular object and so has a null marker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(linguistics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Incorporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third strategy is incorporation, where a language productively forms compound words where the verb includes the object. English doesn't do this very productively - our compounds are more like individual set combinations. So in the verb &lt;em&gt;babysit&lt;/em&gt; the object &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt; is incorporated, but the meaning of the compound is not obviously derived from its component parts. In incorporating languages this process happens productively with the components often keeping their normal sense. Here is an example from &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom093/full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nuu-chah-nulth&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;maḥt'a-ʔa-mit-ʔiš    čakup   &#xA;house-buy-past-3ind  man     &#xA;'A man bought a house.'&#xA;&#xA;ʔu-ʔaa-mit-ʔiš    maḥt'ii  čakup&#xA;Ø-buy-past-3.ind  house    man&#xA;'A man bought a house.'&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nuu-chah-nulth is called an obligatory incorporating language because if the object is not incorporated a dummy morpheme &lt;code&gt;ʔu&lt;/code&gt; must be used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now while incorporation is used in many languages, we have to be careful about making generalisations as each language incorporates nouns according to its own rules. Some incorporate adjectives, and some don't. Or for example, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom093/full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; an independent noun indicates a specific event, whereas an incorporated noun indicates a more general or habitual meaning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ni-c-qua  in   nacatl&#xA;I-it-eat  the  flesh&#xA;'I eat the flesh.'

Thus, linguists use the words &lt;strong&gt;temporal reference&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;aspectual reference&lt;/strong&gt; to describe the abstract ideas being described, while the words &lt;strong&gt;tense&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;aspect&lt;/strong&gt; are reserved for when such reference is marked grammatically. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simplified explanation for tense and aspect usually given is that tense describes when an event occurs and aspect describes the internal temporal structure of an event. However, this doesn't give a ton of easy answers to &quot;is this grammatical form marking tense, aspect, or both?&quot; Formal semanticists actually have a relatively simple framework for how temporal reference and aspectual reference are defined, the basic concepts of which can be helpful when designing your conlang's own tense/aspect system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Neo-Reichenbachian Model&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a timeline:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Earlier                                  Later&#xA;&amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine there are two spans on that timeline (the fact that they're spans is important -- nothing is truly instantaneous). The time when you make an utterance is called the &lt;strong&gt;utterance time&lt;/strong&gt; (or UT), and the time that you're talking &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; is called the &lt;strong&gt;topic time&lt;/strong&gt; (or TT). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal reference describes the relationship between the TT and UT&lt;/strong&gt;. Past temporal reference is when the TT precedes the UT; future temporal reference when the TT follows the UT; and present temporal reference when they overlap. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past:&#xA;    &amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;                |--TT--|          |--UT--|&#xA;&#xA;Future:&#xA;    &amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;          |--UT--|                  |--TT--|&#xA;&#xA;Present:&#xA;                            |--UT--|&#xA;    &amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;                     |-------TT-------|&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems pretty intuitive -- if the section of the timeline you're talking about precedes the time you make the utterance, you'll use the past tense; if it follows it, you'll use the future; and if they overlap, you'll use the present. Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what of aspect? Well, aspectual reference isn't as transparent at that. To describe aspectual reference, we'll need to pick out a third span that timeline -- the time when the event being described actually happened. We'll call this the &lt;strong&gt;eventuality time&lt;/strong&gt; (or ET).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But wait!&quot; you might object. &quot;Isn't that the same as the topic time? If I'm describing something that happened, surely the time I was talking about is the same as the time that it happened.&quot; However, there is a difference, and it's exactly this difference that gives rise to aspectual reference. Consider the English past perfect in a sentence like the following: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yesterday he had gone to the store.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The English past tense includes past temporal reference, and we've established that this means that the topic time is before the utterance time -- something which is explicitly confirmed by the temporal adverb &quot;yesterday&quot; giving us a more specific topic time. But when does the him-going-to-the-store happen? Probably not yesterday, right? Well, this is because perfect† aspectual reference is when the &lt;em&gt;eventuality time&lt;/em&gt; precedes the &lt;em&gt;topic time&lt;/em&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;aspectual reference describes the relationship between the eventuality time and the topic time&lt;/strong&gt;. It for this reason that the past perfect is used by English speakers for the past-in-past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past Perfect:&#xA;    &amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;          |--ET--|    |--TT--|     |--UT--|&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you can also have the present perfect, right? Well, let's combine our descriptions of the present tense and the perfect aspect and see what we come up with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Present Perfect:&#xA;                            |--UT--|&#xA;    &amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;        |--ET--|     |-------TT-------|&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, the topic time and utterance time overlap, which is why you can't say something like &quot;Yesterday he has gone to the store.&quot; However, the eventuality time precedes the topic time, so &lt;em&gt;you're describing an event that happened in the past in relation to the present&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, this is how we see the present perfect used in English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is far from the most interesting thing aspectual reference can do, however. Let's discuss the popular aspectual references, perfective and imperfect. For those who don't know, perfective and perfect are two different things. Perfective is often described as simply viewing an event as a point on a timeline, and imperfect as viewing it as a span. How do we define this as a relationship between eventuality time and topic time?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, a simple way people do it (ignoring a few other related thorny semantic problems that few here will care about) is by defining the perfective as when the eventuality time is contained within the topic time and the imperfect as when the topic time is contained within the eventuality time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past Perfective:&#xA;               |--ET--|&#xA;    &amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;        |-------TT-------|        |--UT--|     &#xA;&#xA;Past Imperfect:&#xA;               |--TT--|&#xA;    &amp;lt;--------------------------------------------&amp;gt;&#xA;        |-------ET-------|        |--UT--|     &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This results, at least formally, in the same sort of perspective shift we try to intuitively describe as changing the event from a &quot;point&quot; to a &quot;span&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that tense and aspect vary between languages a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, and even related languages can't be counted upon to have the same semantics here. After all, the French passé composé, while very similar in form to the English present perfect, does not share the same semantics (it's more of a perfective). Additionally, while a given language's system of tense and aspect will often combine a tense and an aspect in a certain inflection (such as the perfective past tenses in many European languages), this doesn't mean the two are wed cross-linguistically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I hope this answer has given some conlangers the tools to try and invent their own tenses, aspects, or combinations of the two that they haven't themselves encountered cross-linguistically. Be creative!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In short:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Temporal reference is the relationship between the utterance time (when you say something) and the topic time (the time relevant to the discussion at hand).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aspectual reference is the relationship between the topic time (see above) and the eventuality time (the time when the event being described actually occured).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tense is the grammaticalization of temporal reference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aspect is the grammaticalization of aspectual reference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Things called &quot;tenses&quot; in natural languages (as well as in conlangs, to be honest) are often conflations of tense and aspect (and sometimes even mood, but we're not here to talk about that).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;†When I refer to perfect aspectual reference, I'm actually more specifically describing what is known in semantics as the existential perfect. Perfect forms in English and many other languages include other types of perfect aspectual reference (universal, resultive, etc.) that differ subtly in their semantics, and other aspectual and temporal baggage as well; this is, however, probably not particularly interesting or relevant to most people here at this moment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="52" LastEditorUserId="113" LastEditDate="2018-02-20T06:00:02.473" LastActivityDate="2018-02-20T06:00:02.473" CommentCount="16" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Registers vary because the language is used for different purposes, in different contexts and for different audiences. For example, there is a legal register, a register of advertising, registers of banking and a register of weather forecasting. We commonly recognise registers because of their specialised vocabulary but also because of particular uses of grammar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much like how we have registers for differing social contexts (&quot;street talk&quot; or &quot;formal gatherings&quot; or &quot;liturgical worship&quot;), Anglish is simply another register. In this case, I'd argue that the social context is one of distinct national identity vs worldwide loss of identity. Anglish is clearly a distinct variety or style of English --- it is &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; pure and simple! --- and it is used for the particular purpose of distinguishing English English (&lt;em&gt;Our English&lt;/em&gt;) from World English (&lt;em&gt;Everyone's English&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://anglish.wikia.com/wiki/What_is_Anglish%3F&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anglish Moot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; goes into some detail here. &lt;em&gt;The Anglish/New English project is intended as a means of recovering the Englishness of English and of restoring ownership of the language to the English people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In linguistics, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;register&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is simply a &quot;variety of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.&quot; In the case of Anglish, the purpose is as stated: to communicate using a &lt;em&gt;restored &amp;amp; nativising&lt;/em&gt; form of English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an artifact, it can't really be called an &lt;em&gt;invented language&lt;/em&gt;, because it isn't really a thing &quot;invented&quot;. And certainly not in the usually understood sense of the concept of an invented language.

From the I-a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua_grammar#Verbs&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grammar article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under Verbs, we can see exactly what has been done with Latin's principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All personal inflexion is stripped off, so there can be no &quot;first principal part&quot; as such. However, the Latin present stem remains largely intact, so the I-a present tense could continue to serve as first principal part.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The infinitive remains distinct.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The old Latin perfect stems have all been obliterated; the I-a past tense is formed upon the Latin imperfect (present stem), so there can be no &quot;third principal part&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Latin past participle remains in I-a.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could say the principal parts of an Interlingua verb are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parla, parlar, parlate&lt;br&gt;&#xA;dice, dicer, dicíte&lt;br&gt;&#xA;senti, sentir, séntite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interlingua is not entirely regular as regards its verbal system.

There are but two principal parts, both surviving from Latin:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parlar, parlato&lt;br&gt;&#xA;fazer, fazeto&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sabir, sabito&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The present tense, imperative and infinitive are all wrapped within the immutable infinitive; the past and past participle are wrapped up within the old perfect participle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple odd forms. For example, in the Pater Noster we find &lt;em&gt;noi volir ki nomi di ti star &lt;strong&gt;saluti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of which I (having no grammar of the language available) can only imagine to be a past participle of saluer. Why the -i termination and why not &quot;salueto&quot;, I don't know. Obviously Sabir was not &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to level all irregularity. It evolved naturally and over a long period of time within a broad geographical region. Oddities are bound to survive / arise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padri di noi, ki star in syelo,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;noi volir ki nomi di ti star saluti.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Noi volir ki il paisi di ti star kon noi,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;i ki ti lasar ki tuto il populo fazer volo di ti&lt;br&gt;&#xA;na tera, syemi syemi ki nel syelo.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Dar noi sempri pani di noi di kada jorno,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;i skuzar per noi li kulpa di noi,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;syemi syemi ki noi skuzar kwesto populo ki fazer kulpa a noi.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Non lasar noi tenir katibo pensyeri,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ma tradir per noi di malu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_language&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occidental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another invented Romance IAL. I really don't know much about it beyond a couple articles I've read online. Even so, we can easily pick out the remaining principal parts from a good sample text:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;da, dar, dat&lt;br&gt;&#xA;inducte, inducter, inductet&lt;br&gt;&#xA;veni, venir, venit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with Interlingua and Sabir, the morphology of person is eliminated, leaving only a present stem. Also, the perfect stem itself is eliminated. This leaves us three principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patre nor, qui es in li cieles,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;mey tui nómine esser sanctificat,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;mey tui regnia venir,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;mey tui vole esser fat,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;qualmen in li cieles talmen anc sur li terre.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Da nos hodie nor pan omnidial,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;e pardona nor débites,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;qualmen anc noi pardona nor debitores.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;E ne inducte nos in tentation,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ma libera nos de lu mal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frathwiki.com/Romanal&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romanal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was another invented Romance IAL. I have again no reference grammar, but a perusal of a text shows some interesting morphology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;das, dar, dat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forms like &lt;em&gt;ne nos inducas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dimitta&lt;/em&gt; speak of the survival of Latin negative imperative and possibly imperative forms as well. Romanal is well worth the visit for the spiffy verbal conjugation alone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patro nostri,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;qui est en cieles,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sanctificat estas nomine tui,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;advenias regne tui,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;fias volite tui,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sicut en ciele, et en terre.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Il pane nostri quotidiani das ad nos hodie,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;et dimittas nostri debites,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sicut et nus dimitta debitantos nostri,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;et ne nos inducas in tentatione,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sed liberas nos ex male.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frathwiki.com/Medial_Europan&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medial Europan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was another invented Romance IAL.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would seem, from the given text, that all distinctions of conjugation have been reduced to but one. We can see that the present tense and infinitive are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pintit, pintir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Un englo, un franco ed un deuto havit le taske pintir kamele.

Its verbal system is the most reduced respecting the old Latin principal parts.

Spatial prepositions and adverbs are often derived from relevant body parts: front from face, forehead, nose, chest; back from back or butt; up from head… you get the picture. Basically every organ has been referred to as being the cause of emotions etc as well in metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Words for &lt;strong&gt;directions&lt;/strong&gt; in particular are also somewhat based on human anatomy. We have lateral symmetry (left-right) but an alien could likely have some form of radial symmetry in their bodies, which would make the concepts of leftness and rightness very weird to them. Aquatic beings would also likely have a different concept of directions altogether, probably based more on the orientation of their own bodies than relative to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are the things that come to mind. However, much more importantly, the inner workings of language as a whole would likely be different from a human’s. There are some things in human language that you really wouldn’t assume to be necessary. Just to make two examples: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty clear that humans take the raw audio input, break it into &lt;strong&gt;segments&lt;/strong&gt; (phones) then further abstract those phones into &lt;strong&gt;phonemes&lt;/strong&gt;, which are then in turn used to build more complex words. One could just as well imagine skipping the segmentation step and going directly from audio to meaning. There appears to be evidence however that some songbirds also employ what could be considered phonemes in their songs, so perhaps it is to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is in syntax: human language does not appear to allow circular dependencies, that is word¹ A modifying word B, which in turn modifies word A again. From my fairly limited understanding of syntax, human sentences can be structured in a tree structure.

In contrast tense (at its most basic degree, ignoring semantic expansion) is interested to whether it happens before or after now, and aspect with overall temporal relation (hence the possibility of contrast between tenses within a given aspect).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rosenfelder describes Palmer's classification of modals like so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Factual&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Epistemic: speculative, assumptive &amp;amp; deductive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Evidential: reported, sensory &amp;amp; deductive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Deontic&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;External: obligative, permissive, commissive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Internal: abilitive &amp;amp; volitive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Most discussions bundle all of the &quot;factual&quot; branch as one &quot;evidentials&quot; category because languages with evidentials tend to have only one of the two sub-branches, which is also why deductive is listed twice without being self-contradictory)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically working from that, a &lt;strong&gt;mood&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;what happen when modality bundles up with tense&lt;/em&gt;, and there it gets a little messy. Terminologically, Rosenfelder believes that indicative/subjunctive and realis/irrealis systems are separated more clearly by geography (specialists in given language families prefer one or the other) than grammatical reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, realis/indicative applies protoypically to real events, irrealis/subjunctive to &quot;less real&quot; stuff. What is included in each category may vary considerably (future events and imperative may categorize in either one, for example, depending on individual languages). Conditionals are irrealis in virtually all systems, but in Indo-European linguistics are traditionally treated as a third mood separate from both indicative and subjunctive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, moods are often more of a semantic division within the verbal paradigm owing to the lack of a separate marker for them (in most European languages I'm aware of, for example). When an explicit irrealis marker exists, it often takes over separate marking for tense and aspect, that is, there will be no overt marking of the subcategories like future vs. imperative (both only irrealis) or past vs. present (both realis). &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manam_language#Mood&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Manam&lt;/a&gt; is such a language (how unusual this is is unclear from Rosenfelder's writing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="128" LastActivityDate="2018-02-19T15:25:16.483" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Now comes the confusion - because that is what languages do, they confuse tense and aspect, in incoherent and incomplete systems that fail to either integrate or clearly separate those features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One first source of confusion is that many languages operate not only with the simple distinction between tenses as outlined above - past, present, future - but also with dependent and independent tenses. For instance, I may say&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to eat sushi when Susan introduced me to Javanese food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi while the president threats nuclear war against North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will be eating sushi when they bring the wine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in which one action is past, present or future regarding the time of the speech (Susan introduced me to Javanese food in the past, the president is threatening nuclear war in the present, they will bring wine in the future) while the other (me eating sushi) happens in the present - not the present regarding the time of speech, however, but the present regarding the other action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And while this may be a source of confusion by itself, it expands to a further level of confusion because the interaction between dependent and independent action often has implications on the aspectuality of each of them. For instance, I say&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I eat sushi. - or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is understood that these are different aspects: in the first sentence, I am saying that I do habitually eat sushi, not that I have a dish of sushi in front of me. In the second sentence, however, I am saying that I am actually eating sushi in the moment I am talking, so the sentences are not synonim to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if I say&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I eat sushi. - or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I am eating sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the phrase &amp;quot;eat sushi&amp;quot; loses its habitual aspect, and turn into continuous, and the sentences are effectively synonimous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The there is the confusion that Sparksbet remarks, between &amp;quot;tense&amp;quot; as a grammatical form, and &amp;quot;tense&amp;quot; as a reference to actual time. As she says, &amp;quot;tenses&amp;quot; as grammatical forms are used to denote a mix of tense references and aspectual references.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while the tense and aspectual references can be several, their grammaticalization, or lack thereof, is much more constrained. For instance, neither English, nor any other Western European language that I know has verb inflections for iterative or inceptive aspects. They instead use either syntactical devices, or morphological derivation - and those often vary weirdly from lexical item to lexical item. Let's take for instance Portuguese:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eu como sushi&lt;/em&gt; (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou comendo sushi&lt;/em&gt; (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou beliscando uns sushis&lt;/em&gt; (iterative) (where a different verb is used to make the aspectual reference)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eu bebo uísque&lt;/em&gt; (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou bebendo uísque&lt;/em&gt; (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou bebericando uísque&lt;/em&gt; (iterative) (where a morphological derivation of &amp;quot;beber&amp;quot; is used to make the aspectual reference)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, probably no natural language has a coherent tense-aspect system; the fact that some tenses seem to imply some aspects when put in relation to others probably means that, for reasons of economy, grammatical &amp;quot;tenses&amp;quot; will be used irregularly, given internal or even external context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could it be possible to build a conlang with a complete and coherent tense-aspect system?

(Such behaviour would be entirely unacceptable in Germany where it is expected for the finished product to arrive five minutes before the deadline.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A number of common — to them — proverbs would underline this expectation.

I now recall it - and though the persons concerned having died long since makes my little anecdote mere hearsay and in no way veridical, I thought I'd forward it. An old friend, a retired military man with an amateur interest in codes and cyphers, once showed me a couple of not entirely distinct b&amp;amp;w copies of pages from a curious coded manuscript, which I now realise were a couple of folios of the VMs. I was not especially interested in them at the time, I think, but the reason that the incident made an impression was that he said that they had been given to him by Prof JRR Tolkien. At that time I had just discovered and was very much 'into' Tolkien so I was most envious of my friend's knowing him and pressed for details of the great man, though in the end I never achieved my longed-for personal introduction. So I now wonder if there might be any reference anywhere in the mass of Tolkien papers to our VMs, and is this of any possible slight significance? After all, JRRT knew a great deal about languages and artificial scripts of course and if he was interested enough to make and pass on copies to a friend, he might have devoted some time to the VMs himself. And the Voynichese script does have a Tolkien-ish look to it or vice versa: could it have influenced him?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(this was found through a link from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ciphermysteries.com/2008/01/16/voynich-manuscript-in-existing-novels&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;CipherMysteries.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, since his development started before the Voynich manuscript was discovered, I'd say that it's... kinda &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; that he was inspired by it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastActivityDate="2018-02-21T14:03:28.580" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Mostly because &quot;language concepts&quot; (e.g. tense-aspect-mood systems, animacy, verbal valence, case systems...) reflect the workings of the &lt;em&gt;human mind&lt;/em&gt; far, far more than they could ever reflect the human anatomy. Anatomy/biology of course influences massive swathes of &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;, but I don't think anything other than pure phonetics or sign language is influenced by anatomy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Facial expressions and body language probably belong there, but tend to have a huge cultural element. Position of the ears, for example, is not something humans make (or can make) use of, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://hornedfreak.tumblr.com/post/171381092902/elf-ear-communication-headcannon&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;maybe elves could&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some more semantics example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We make distinctions useful to us &lt;em&gt;at our given size&lt;/em&gt;. We cannot tell apart things by smell, or by UV light the way other animals (or measuring instruments) can. We do not tell apart very tiny things by basic names (e.g. ants, mites, sand). If we could sense, say, gravitic variations or psychic energies, we might have entirely different ways to describe position or time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time is linear to us&lt;/em&gt;, cause precedes effects and so on, we cannot watch again a past event.

No attempts were made to keep much linguistic continuity, and so it's not a constructed language as such. There are probably &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; similarities to ancient Egyptian, but likely not many. I include it here only because its use of some ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs is notable; it appears that an alphabet for the language was indeed constructed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?t=43643&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Irǧeret&lt;/a&gt; (Egyptian and Akkadian, with Ugaritic, Arabic and Hebrew influences)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one seems decently documented by its author. The vocabulary and phonology are derived from Egyptian, although there isn't much vocabulary listed. The organization of nouns - in number and gender - resembles Akkadian.

Proto-Indo-European is certainly antique; whether it's &amp;quot;lesser-known&amp;quot; is perhaps another question entirely. That said, it's not a terribly common template, and so I'm listing some Proto-Indo-European languages here for the sake of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sambahsa.pbworks.com/w/page/10183084/FrontPage%7CThe&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sambahsa&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambahsa&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sambahsa&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;international auxiliary language&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be heavily influenced by Proto-Indo-European, primarily through vocabulary.

According to the linked website, Okrand&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;took Proto-Indo-European roots and then compared them with language families at various points in time from around the world.  Where similarities between words existed, he altered the root or its semantic value to reflect that similarity.  By the combination of the PIE roots and by the adoption of new roots from these world languages, he created a vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that these languages borrow vocabulary from many descendants of Proto-Indo-European, you could argue that they're not directly based in it.

Láadan is just a bunch of specialized jargon, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphysical obsessions&lt;/strong&gt;. In most languages, we have to care about these issues like when it happened and the gender of the speakers and we have to care about it in every sentence, even if it isn't otherwise topical. In English, you have to choose a gender or animacy status for a pronoun even if the distinction is irrelevant. Japanese making honorific/politeness markers obligatory is a perfect example. If I ever get around to writing a language, I plan to use this strategy, although, it only works with features that everything has. For example, if I make &quot;edibility&quot; a necessary grammatical marker, I may have to waste a lot of air on &quot;inedible&quot; and &quot;doesn't apply&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sapir-Whorf&lt;/strong&gt;.

German words fit together like a car engine and that is why they make such great cars. You have to form these sentences very carefully, so the people who speak the language must be very careful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the mechanics—these show up as prefixes/affixes to nouns, adjective etc, or lexical distinctions, or a lack of lexical gaps.

The environment is fairly static, so you don't need complicated phrases to refer to things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One aspect would be communicating with the ship's computer (assuming a natural language interface) or texts.

(In contrast, for example, Old English arose from the Anglo-Saxon invasion of a linguistically Celtic and Latin speaking island, and Middle English arose as the main modification in the wake of England's conquest by a French speaking Normal elite and England was extremely involved in contacting other civilizations globally as part of its diplomatic, trade and cultural interactions with Europe and as a result of its global empire.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iceland was an uninhabited island (hence not subject to any substrate influences unlike many other colonists) settled in the historic era by colonists who spoke a single shared language fairly close to &amp;quot;Old Norse&amp;quot; (the proto-language of the Germanic languages), who had a total population similar to that of a generation ship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat more subtly, Iceland's colonists were looking for economic opportunities, rather than constituting a cultural minority fleeing persecution in their homeland the way, for example, that the Puritan colonists of New England were, so they were not motivated at the outset to intentionally set out to put linguistic and cultural distance between themselves and the speakers of their original mother tongue the way that early Americans deliberately attempted to distinguish themselves linguistically from England to assert a distinct cultural identity. The Iceland situation of a group of people not committed ideologically to putting cultural distance between themselves and their ancestor population would likely also be true of the people on a generation ship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The descendants of the original colonists of Iceland remained in constant communication with each other ever after, just as generation ship residents would, although this did break up from a single community into about a dozen or so chiefdoms that were substantially autonomous from each other and had distinct identities although they did retain a very thin form of island-wide weak government. So, tribal divisions, per se, do not distinguish a generation ship from Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, Iceland received almost no significant waves of migration prior to the recent past, so it has never had a large community of outside language learners to influence its linguistic development (just as would be the case in a generation ship).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While Iceland wasn't as isolated from other people as generation ship would be, for a period of time roughly equal to the length of a generation ship journey prior to the introduction of telecommunications, Iceland was very isolated from the rest of the world, and the vast majority of what little contact it did have with the rest of the world from visiting ships was with people who spoke the closest linguistic relative of their language in the world. So, it did not have any languages from which to borrow words, and it was not subject to any areal effects from neighboring languages in a significant way (apart from Danish rule whose effect is noted below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Icelandic is by far the most linguistically static of the Germanic languages, with the only significant change being a change in pronunciation that arose during a several century period of Danish rule, a country that speaks a closely related by different language derived from Old Norse. A generation ship would not experience this outside influence and would not need to develop a new written language as Iceland did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Wikipedia explains (at the link above):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD.&#xA;Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved&#xA;orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in Iceland&#xA;from the 12th century onward, are the Icelandic Sagas. They comprise&#xA;the historical works and the eddaic poems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language of the sagas is Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old&#xA;Norse. The Dano-Norwegian, then later Danish rule of Iceland from 1536&#xA;to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic (in contrary&#xA;to the Norwegian language), which remained in daily use among the&#xA;general population. Though more archaic than the other living Germanic&#xA;languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th&#xA;to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, á, æ, au,&#xA;and y/ý).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard&#xA;established in the 19th century, primarily by the Danish linguist&#xA;Rasmus Rask. It is based strongly on an orthography laid out in the&#xA;early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as The First&#xA;Grammatical Treatise by an anonymous author, who has later been&#xA;referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard&#xA;was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit&#xA;concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of k rather&#xA;than c. Various archaic features, as the letter ð, had not been used&#xA;much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in&#xA;practice. Later 20th-century changes include the use of é instead of&#xA;je and the removal of z from the Icelandic alphabet in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not&#xA;changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts&#xA;were written on vellum. Modern speakers can understand the&#xA;original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years&#xA;ago.&lt;/strong&gt; The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and&#xA;footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of&#xA;Shakespeare). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand&#xA;the original manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, usually new vocabulary is developed in response to new topics of conversation. Since the environment would change less and there would be fewer new things on a generation ship than in Iceland over the same time period (in part, due to a generation ship's lack of trade with the outside world that Iceland had) one would expect there to be less innovation in vocabulary on a generation ship than there was in Iceland. Still, as noted by @Hyperneutrino one might expect words that residents of a generation ship have no reason to use to be lost early on from popular speech (although presumably written sources would still preserve the old words for those so inclined, as a generation ship's residents would not be illiterate and written languages stabilize spelling and prevent old words from dying completely), and there would be a few new words developed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another clue with which I have first hand experience, which corroborates the example of Iceland, is the development of motherland languages in immigrant communities. For example, the dialect of Korean spoken in Korean immigrant communities in the U.S. that formed shortly after the Korean War is much more similar to the dialect spoken at the time of migration than the dialect of Korean currently spoken in South Korea, notwithstanding the fact that there have been many visits to South Korea and there has been access to modern Korean television and music in that time period in the U.S. Small, relatively isolated communities are simply much less linguistically innovative than large communities that are strongly connected to neighboring communities that speak different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary then, it is likely that the language of a generation ship would be extremely static over a period of approximately 1,000 years, because generally speaking it would be in conditions very similar to those of Iceland which historically has had an extremely static language over a similar time period under similar conditions. And, several of the factors that are know to have led to the modest changes between Old Icelandic and Modern Iceland over that time period would be absent on a generation ship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="343" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:27.510" LastActivityDate="2018-03-03T20:42:00.520" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I would expect the real situation to be somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One extreme happens when the population of the generation ship just speaks a random language, or several. And when it either does not bring a large library or somehow manages to lose or forget it (e.g. due to religious extremism).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case there will be natural language change. Here are some things that fuel language change:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The desire of a younger generation to assert their identity linguistically gives rise to youth language. As they grow older, part of their youth language becomes standard.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unstressed syllables are pronounced less and less carefully, giving rise to phonetic changes. E.g., several distinctive vowels may merge into a single neutral vowel when unstressed. Vowels or consonants may even get lost.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The desire to express ourselves drastically in certain situation gives rise to new rules of grammar. E.g., this is how the future tense and the progressive aspect in English arose. (Neither existed in Proto-Germanic.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As a word or expression is used increasingly in a specific sense, sometimes it is no longer appropriate to use it in its original sense. This drift of meaning then creates a gap that will likely be filled by a new word or expression or by initiating a similar process for another, existing one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors exist on a generation ship. As ohwilleke pointed out, two other factors - changing environment and contact with other languages (which also evolve) do not exist on a generation ship. (At least in the long run. Of course the first few generations will adapt their vocabulary and probably even grammar to the unique situation. E.g., some Australian languages use compass directions or geographical directions w.r.t. a specific valley instead of left and right. Something equivalent would make even more sense on a generation ship.) Therefore we can expect this language change to be really slow. Ohwilleke's example of Iceland gives us an idea of what to expect. If the ship's population starts with English, then after 1000 years they have a good chance to understand today's English to some extent. (To a greater extent if they continue reading books in today's English.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since, realistically, a generation ship to Alpha Centauri would be travelling for many thousands of years, without further stabilising factors we can expect that they would arrive speaking a language that is at most vaguely similar to the one they started with. I would not expect this language to have unusual features compared to languages currently spoken on Earth. There might, however, be some grammatical structures related to the special situation on the ship. And there might also be a large number of irregularities, as is often the case for languages of small speaker communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A generation ship will probably bring a large library. However, if the population had unrestricted access to it, this might lead to a society that basically lives in the past and will be unable to settle a new planet. But in any case I would expect that some people on board continue to learn Earth languages so they can understand part of that library. Depending on the precise circumstances, this could be a stabilising factor or even fuel language change due to different Earth languages being fashionable at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A civilisation that wants to control the language spoken by the settlers of a distant planet will have to turn linguistics from a descriptive science into a field of engineering. They may be able to create a language that is a lot more stable than any naturally occurring language. This doesn't mean there is no change at all, but it means that significant change is normally cyclic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Language change is already largely cyclic in terms of high-level features of languages. E.g., if a language does not have a past tense, then a composite tense like present perfect will likely come up to fill this gap. The auxiliaries will then merge with the verbs that carry the meaning, becoming suffixes or prefixes. They will slowly lose stress, become unrecognisable as auxiliaries, become indistinguishable from each other and finally will disappear, so that the language again doesn't have a past tense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an isolated speaker community, it might be possible to come up with a language A such that after one such cycle a language B results that is mutually intelligible with A to a strong degree. Now the speakers of B will likely read a lot of the literary output of the speakers of A, leading to further stabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extending this idea, we one might come up with a family of languages that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; in principle have cyclically evolved out of each other. Say half a dozen such languages. By providing an extensive and stimulating library in all of these languages, it could be possible to make language evolution essentially cyclic throughout the flight, so that at the end everyone will be speaking a variation of one of the library languages (possibly an intermediate stage). But it also seems likely that this would lead to a multilingual situation (with several library languages spoken simultaneously), so that one would also have to consider contact effects between these languages. And, perhaps more importantly, to conscious efforts to create linguistic innovations that are not represented in the library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: I arrived at these last thoughts from a different angle. In the extreme case, success of an international language such as Esperanto would mean that everybody in the world speaks Esperanto and only Esperanto. But this is not a stable situation, at least not with an essentially random language such as Esperanto. So I thought about whether there can be a language that would remain the only language spoken on Earth once it managed to get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user354" LastEditorDisplayName="user354" LastEditDate="2018-03-06T10:58:19.123" LastActivityDate="2018-03-06T10:58:19.123" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

First, some general numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over 1000 years, Old High German split into the various southern German dialects, including Swiss German and Standard German. While differences are very noticable, many developments were parallel and speakers usually don’t take long to get accustomed to the differences. A similar time depth can be claimed for English vs Scots. Old High German itself is not readily intelligible to the modern speaker, but many words are recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2000 years ago, we had Latin and Proto-Germanic, the ancestors of the Romance and Germanic branches of Indo-European. While the modern languages all show clear similarities in most regards of the language, they are as a general rule not mutually intelligible and speakers need to invest a lot of time to learn another of those languages - but still much less than with an unrelated language. Proto-Germanic and Latin are both quite different than the modern languages, showing vast differences in morphology and syntax, as well as having undergone many sound changes since. Nevertheless, with some knowledge on etymology, words can readily be recognized for what they are in a written text. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About 4000-6000 years ago, we have PIE. At this point, the language is no longer immediately recognizable as being related to a modern European language. The grammar is very different - just as an example, PIE verbs inflect for three persons and three numbers, but not directly for tense or aspect, which are instead marked with various more-or-less productive derivational affixes. The phonology would also look very out of place in modern day Europe. And for most roots, even if they didn’t change much phonologically, there was probably a semantic shift somewhere between PIE and English. The average English speaker will understand exactly zero words in a passage in Serbian or Punjabi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there’s another side to this as well. General tendencies are fine, but what about individual languages? If you compare Italian and French to Latin, then it’s plainly obvious that French has changed more, at least with regards to phonology and morphology. Similarly, comparing English to Icelandic, the latter is clearly more conservative (though no where near as much as some people might make you believe). To me, French and English look like they are 500+ years further in the future than their contemporary siblings — in reality of course they just underwent some more drastical sound changes that in turn messed with their morphology, which in turn forced changes to the syntax. People try to ascribe those changes to various factors, usually external ones such as a large number of foreign learners, but most of this is not grounded in actual science and just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As such, no definitive answer can be given. I find the time depths I gave above to be good rules of thumb, but single languages may deviate from those quite a bit. To achieve such results, it’s important to apply changes not only to the phonology, but to all parts of the language — especially the lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="53" LastActivityDate="2018-03-05T06:21:18.900" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So in the sentence “Before returning home, he had gone shopping”, the topic time would be the moment of arriving home, and the eventuality time the time of going shopping, and the English past perfect marks that the latter happened before the former.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A logical extension of this system then would be to not only mark for differences in topic and eventuality &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, but also topic and eventuality &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;. In the above sentence, the topic space (or location) would be the home, while the location of the shopping would be the eventuality space. The sentence might then mark for the fact that the shopping center is far away from the home, as opposed to (for example), inside the home. Further distinctions could be made with regards to motion: shopping is fairly stationary, but in “To get home, he had to drive on the highway”, there is clear motion towards the topic space and this too might be marked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I am curious, does anything along these lines exist in natural languages?

A simple set of parallel translations demonstrating the effect of a straightforward morphological or syntactic alternation, for example, may be sufficient for its purpose. But in the general case...

I’ll show in what ways history can manifest with a bunch of examples from different areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost no language with a history of writing has a fully regular orthography. Even if there are regular writing reforms, some aspects of the orthography will just be considered “part of it” and stick. English is of course a very extreme example of this, but you don’t need to take it that far. German for example generally has a rather regular orthography. But the digraph ⟨ie⟩ represents a long /iː/, reflecting that in the past (and in some dialects until the present) there was a diphthong /iə/ in German, which became to be pronounced that way. It also has two separate graphemes for the phonemes /ɛ eː/, namely ⟨e ä⟩, reflecting whether the sound originates from a fronted /a aː/ or not. On top of this, there are some segments which have unpredictable pronunciation: word final -ig for example is pronounced /ɪç/ instead of expected /ɪk/. In short, unless your writing system was designed very recently by linguists, it likely shows leftovers from the past. In the most extreme cases, writing systems can lag behind centuries (English, French, Tibetan), but even if they don’t they can preserve some old features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most languages with inflections show some degree of irregularity among them. This can manifest in many degrees, from almost entirely regular (Swahili has only one class of six slightly irregular verbs, one of which is suppletive in the present tense) to a basically complete lack of predictability (&lt;a href=&quot;http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/eddingtond/navajo.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Navajo verb stems&lt;/a&gt; have defied any attempts to find rules for their inflections thus far. There don’t seem to be distinct paradigms, every verb does its own thing!). However, these irregularities are not random. To show what I mean, compare these two sets of declensions. The first two are latin singular nouns (in an less traditional order), the second two made up on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOM filius rēx      kwero   tulya   &#xA;VOC filiī  rēx      kwerap  tulte&#xA;ACC filium rēgem    kweruf  tultsu&#xA;GEN filiī  rēgis    kwerim  tulne&#xA;DAT filiō  rēgī     kwerx   tulum&#xA;ABL filiō  rēge     kwert   tulwo&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two things should stick out: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Latin forms of rēx show two distinct stems, those ending in /k/ (rēx, where the spelling hides the fact that really it’s rēc-s) and those ending in /g/ (all other forms). Looking a bit closer, we can see that the /g/ appears exactly before those forms with a vowel in the suffix. Intervocalic voicing (which accounts for /k/ becoming /g/) is a common sound change and applies here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in both languages, some of the affixes seem to be unrelated, there are still patterns: nominative takes -s, accusative takes -m, genitive has an -i in the suffix… If we added other paradigms into the comparison, even more such patterns would arise, indicating that they really originate from a much more regular system that got changed up over time by various factors like sound changes. In the made up language, on the other hand, the affixes are entirely random, and this causes the irregularity to look more unnatural than if everything took the same affixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Consonants&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Japanese consonant inventory&lt;/a&gt;. It looks something like this (omitting allophones):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  m |   n |   ɴ |&#xA;p b | t d | k g |&#xA;    | s z |     | h&#xA;    |   r |     |&#xA;    |   j |   w |&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this table does not show however is that /p/ is significantly rarer than /t k/. Why would that be? Simply because many instances of that sound somewhat recently shifted to what is /h/ in modern Japanese. In other words, a sound change caused a significant imbalance in the distribution of sounds. If one were to simply generate words with a word generator, not paying attention to the history of the language, all sounds would show up with similar frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I give you any word, you can probably find several alternative ways of expressing that meaning. “big”, “tall”, “large”, “spacious”, “gigantic”… they all have different connotations, sure, but in the end they’re all descriptions for roughly the same thing - objects which take up a big fraction of your field of view when near them. Meanwhile, many conlangs will have a dictionary entry like &lt;strong&gt;gwop&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;adj&lt;/em&gt; “big” and that’s it. Adding synonyms, especially ones with subtly different meanings allows you to greatly affect the way texts read (in a positive way). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time however, often complicated words are derived from simpler concepts. This naturally has the effect of making them longer, causing a variation in the lengths of words - many short words with a few longer ones in-between is a common pattern. But if you simply create a new root every time you make a word, you won’t get that - and your hypothetical speakers will have to remember every single word without help, even ones they barely ever use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on and list things in every category of linguistics I can think of, but in the end it all boils down to this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Irregularity in languages either preserves older, then-regular systems in now untransparent ways (English verbs are another great case study for this) or are the creation of sound change messing with regularity. The former is the reason why common words tend to be less regular - if you commonly hear a word it’s easier to preserve its original form and remember the irregularity once it has arisen. In the case of Navajo I mentioned above, curiously it seems to be that first sound change caused irregularity, and then the native speakers applying analogy caused the whole system to become even more irregular. See the paper I linked above for some hypotheses on how that worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the actual question: Assume you have a conlang already, and it lacks history and is entirely too regular. “Sterile”, one might say. What can you do? I’d like to present you two options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invent a history for your language. Sketch out how your verbal system may have looked in the past and see if you can lead that to some interesting irregular forms or alterations. Come up with some sound changes that may have led to the current state of the language. You don’t have to do this in great detail, but obviously (as always with conlangs) the more effort you put in, the better it will look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make your language the history. If you don’t mind your end result potentially looking vastly different from what you have now, you can decide to move the  current state of the language into the past. You may have to make some changes to vocabulary to keep it in line with technology, but otherwise there’s not really any difference between a modern language and a “proto-language”. Then, you can track its changes through history in great detail, and in doing so introduce its natural flavour. No one has to know that the proto-language you worked from was unnaturalistic (but you’ll have to live with that knowledge. Just remember that you have to start &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, you can’t derive every conlang from the first utterances of mankind). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a footnote, I’d like to make a book recommendation: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805080120&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Unfolding of Language&lt;/a&gt; by Guy Deutscher.

You could create a pattern with other consonants, e.g. tait &gt; [tac], taid &gt; [taɟ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if some of these options are problematic in your case (maybe you don't want to &quot;contaminate&quot; your agglutinative language), you could still retain the phonemes /tajs/ and just have some of these options as allophones of it (so e.g. [e] or [e:] could be an allophone of /aj/ in a closed syllable, [ɕ] could be an allophone of /js/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is just determine what sounds ugly to you and create phonotactic rules that cover whatever the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58" LastActivityDate="2018-03-23T09:56:39.177" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Though they're all based on spoken languages. All the 'speaker' does is mimic the tonal pattern without pronouncing any phonemes. Such languages are used by hunters to communicate without alerting their quarry, because the language sounds just like bird song. But they don't use this language for most day-to-day communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for a pikachu, well their 'words' are made up of three possible syllables: pi, ka, and chu. Thus a pikachu would have a total of 3 possible one-syllable words, 9 two-syllable words, and 27 three-syllable words. As we see, words would need to get quite long to get the possible vocabulary up to 100. Using tones though would easily multiply this. Even a simple two-tone system would double the number of possible syllables. Thus the syllable count would be 6 one-syllable words, 36 two-syllable words, and 216 three-syllable words. And there are real languages that have as many as 6 tones. With such a system, a pikachu would have 18 possible syllables to work with. Of course, you could say pokemon are more sensitive to tone than humans, which could increase the number of tones beyond what any human could manage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though a problem arises with cross-species communication. Obviously, no two species have the same set of syllables. Thus, for different species to be able to communicate with each other, the poke-language would probably have to be purely tonal, like a whistled language. Though you could 'multiply' the number of tones using length. A tone held for a short time could be considered a separate 'phoneme' from the same tone held longer. But we might just be fooling ourselves. The pokemon may just see a long tone as two identical tones right next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most pokemon of course aren't intelligent enough to warrant a full-fledged language. Even Toki Pona would like contain some words they wouldn't make use of. Yeah, there's things like Alakazam which have an IQ higher than humans, but of course they can communicate telepathically, which would completely remove their need to use a language. And of course, there's some that can learn human language. Team Rocket's Meowth not only can speak, but he even taught himself how to! There's also one of the early movies which features a talking slowking. And one episode of the anime has a tenacool possessing meowth and speaking through him, which would imply it knows and understands human language, but lacks the ability to actually produce human sounds. Though honestly, its astounding that any pokemon could pronounce a human language. We have a lot of features in our mouths unique to our species that allow us to talk. Some birds in the real world can mimic human speech, but they accomplish this differently from how we do. I believe there is a pokemon in one of the later generations that can mimic human speech, though it can't understand language.

Anglo-French was in steady decline after 1300. ... (That English lawyers could seriously complain that French, spoken in France, had deteriorated considerably as compared to its use in England) is in itself a clear demonstration that by the middle of the fifteenth century there was a marked difference between the French of English lawyers and the French of France.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Frenchman living in England during Elizabeth I's reign noted of Law French &quot;...now it seemeth that almost there is no language more far from the true French, then the French of our lawes: There being almost no word, which either by intermingling, or adding, or diminishing, or changing of a letter into another, they have not altered and corrupted.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The lawyers also took what seemed to be a perverse delight in pronouncing Law French as if it were English: indeed, 'their pronunciation differeth so much from ours (French) as it is impossible for a Frenchman to understand them'.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Few of those who used French paid the slightest attention to grammar or vocabulary.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All taken from J.H.

They're going to want to figure out what they mean, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they mean what they mean. Part of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; intention, my particular vision and contribution to this movie, was to create sentences which would be intelligible to the people who study the languages (...) I'm enormously happy to see some people saying based on their knowledge of Elvish, great or small, that they recognized and understood some of what they heard on the screen.

As you can see, a lot of it is attested in Tolkien's works, but there is quite a bit that needed to be invented for the film by Salo. There have been other projects based on Tolkien's Elvish languages in the past as well, but the real fanatics tend to view these as &quot;pseudo-Elvish&quot;, since anything not invented by Tolkien can't really be said to be part of Tolkien's Elvish.

That is, consider these four possible types of grammar rules (they may be other rules a language may follow):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers to the last referent&lt;/strong&gt;, any mention of a prior referent must be renamed. So in your example, the grammar would remove the ambiguity as such a rule would refer to James in your original example:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if Adam was the intent, then it would need to be one of these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help Adam with his writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To James, Adam sent the essay to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers to the far referent when two referents are in view&lt;/strong&gt;, and is left off when the near referent is intended. So of James getting help, no pronoun is used, and the sentence would roughly translate simply as:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help with writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But of Adam, the pronoun would be used:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers back to a subject&lt;/strong&gt;, never an object (which must be restated if intended). So of James:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help James with James's writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though I suspect something like #2 for James might be stated as well; or the language would form such a statement to place the main player in the subject position in a passive construction:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;James was sent an essay by Adam to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Adam, it would be as you originally stated:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers back to an object&lt;/strong&gt;, never the subject (which is restated if intended).

The words &lt;em&gt;Lilliputian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brobdignagian&lt;/em&gt; have also entered the language from the same source, as have &lt;em&gt;big-endian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;little-endian&lt;/em&gt;, supposedly calques from the fictional Lilliputian language.  &lt;em&gt;Utopia&lt;/em&gt; is the endonym for the island nation of Thomas More’s novel, although it’s derived from Greek roots.  Several of the portmanteau words Lewis Caroll had his characters from Wonderland or his other fictional settings say have become real words, for example, &lt;em&gt;chortled&lt;/em&gt;.  These might be considered words from an invented dialect.  &lt;em&gt;Munchkin&lt;/em&gt;, from L. Frank Baum’s &lt;em&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt;, has become both a dictionary word for a small person and a slang word for an immature powergamer.  (Arguably, &lt;em&gt;Oz&lt;/em&gt; has become a nickname for Australia.)  &lt;em&gt;Robot&lt;/em&gt; is another common word that might qualify: it was a trademark in the play &lt;em&gt;Rossum’s Universal Robots&lt;/em&gt;, derived from Czech roots.  None of these, however, were ever fleshed out into complete conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another well-known example is &lt;em&gt;Idaho&lt;/em&gt;, a made-up name that was passed off as a word from some Native language that supposedly meant, “gem of the mountains” even though the Natives did not mine or cut gems.  As far as we know, a man named William Craig just invented it as a hoax.  This was originally proposed as a name for what is now Colorado, but voted down in Congress after a blistering speech by Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon, who said, “I do not believe it is an Indian word, [...] No Indian tribe in the nation has that word [...] It is a corruption certainly, a counterfeit, and ought not to be adopted.” No one has any idea where the word &lt;em&gt;Oregon&lt;/em&gt; comes from, either, but certainly not any language native to the Pacific Northwest, so it’s only fair that Lane relented in 1863 when the name was re-used for the entirely different territory that still bears it today. There are many other stories of made-up foreign-sounding names becoming official, including Plano, Texas, which does not really mean flatland in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I can’t think of a good example from Tolkien: &lt;em&gt;Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has become a name for the extinct species &lt;em&gt;Homo Floresensis&lt;/em&gt;, but within the conceit of the novel, Tolkien used it as the translation from his conlang into English.  Hobbit is an obscure Old English word that had been used occasionally before.  Tolkien reveals in the appendix to &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; that it was an English calque for the actual endonym &lt;em&gt;Kuduk&lt;/em&gt; in his conlang, meaning Hole-Dweller. Similarly, most of the other words in Tolkien that sound exotic were revived from Old English as “translations” from his conlangs, along with the obsolete plural forms &lt;em&gt;elves&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dwarves&lt;/em&gt; that he personally brought back.  He might have a strong claim that the word &lt;em&gt;orc&lt;/em&gt; today brings to mind his &lt;em&gt;orch&lt;/em&gt;, translated from his conlangs into English as &lt;em&gt;orc&lt;/em&gt;, but which is nothing like the sea-monster named &lt;em&gt;Orc&lt;/em&gt; in the myth of Perseus and Andromeda, so the word should just be considered a homophone.  The most familiar words from his conlangs themselves, not translated into English, would be the inscription on the One Ring.  That is, unless you consider the English translations in the body of the text a conlang!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, the writers originally borrowed names from Western mythology, like Vulcan and Romulan, and later on, when they developed more serious conlangs for those species, came up with the justification that they didn’t really call themselves that in their own languages at all.  However, loghaD gives the example of &lt;em&gt;Qapla'&lt;/em&gt;, from Klingon, occasionally used by SF geeks to mean “Success!” in English, although it would not be familiar to most native speakers.  I’ve heard geeks drop words and phrases from many sources about as often, like &lt;em&gt;grok&lt;/em&gt; from Robert Heinlein’s Martian and &lt;em&gt;Bah-weep-graaaaagnah wheep nini bong&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Transformers: The Movie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kryptonite&lt;/em&gt;, now used as a generic word for an Achilles’ heel, was retconned into the alien endonym &lt;em&gt;Krypton&lt;/em&gt;, a combination of the names of the Adam and Eve-figures of the alien species, Kryp and Tonn, plus the scientific suffix &lt;em&gt;-ite&lt;/em&gt;.  That it’s a homonym of a different chemical element in English is, in-universe, a coincidence.  This is of course from DC Comics’ &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Murry Gell-Mann has said he took the word &lt;em&gt;quark&lt;/em&gt; from a nonsense poem in James Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Finnegan’s Wake&lt;/em&gt;, where it could have meant many different things at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several other made-up words in science fiction that have become at least somewhat widely-known.  &lt;em&gt;Ansible&lt;/em&gt;, by Ursula K. LeGuin, has been borrowed by many other works of science fiction.  &lt;em&gt;Zeerust&lt;/em&gt;, from Douglas Adams’ &lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Laff&lt;/em&gt; (which gave geographic names joke definitions) is actually used by some writers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;particularly at TV Tropes&lt;/a&gt;, in the sense he gave it: the particular kind of datedness of something that tried to be futuristic way back when.  &lt;em&gt;Morlocks&lt;/em&gt;, from H.G. Wells’ &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;, appears in some dictionaries as a generic term for feral people. At least one college gave freshmen an orientation course called “Finding your Patronus,” after the spell from &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s anybody’s guess where Biblical and other mythological names that have become dictionary words, such as &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;cherubic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Semitic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;siren&lt;/em&gt;, came from, but one possibility is that some were made up from whole cloth at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless you are an especially fundamentalist member of the Latter-Day Saints movement (not the same thing as a member of the FLDS!), you consider Joseph Smith’s Reformed Egyptian a conlang that gave us such words as &lt;em&gt;Deseret&lt;/em&gt;.  If any example I mentioned is from a scripture you believe to be literally true, I respect your religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One edge case: a &lt;em&gt;barbarian&lt;/em&gt; originally meant someone who didn’t speak Greek, and who sounded to the Greeks like he was saying “bar-bar-bar.”  There’s a joke like this in what might be considered a work of ancient SF, Aristophanes’ &lt;em&gt;The Birds&lt;/em&gt;, where a foreign god speaks only in nonsense syllables that the picaresque heroes pretend to translate, and although none of them became words, the calque &lt;em&gt;Cloudcuckooland&lt;/em&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of those are words in English, but you asked about loanwords from any conlang to any natural language.  Someone else brought up the conlang Esperanto, which now has native speakers (although I’m not aware of any loanwords from Esperanto in natural languages other than the name of the language itself).  Some other answers on this site have suggested that Classical Sanskrit or Modern Hebrew might be considered conlangs of a sort, which in the process of turning a natural language into a literary language more like what its compilers wanted it to be, created a new one.  One might then bring several others up, such as Old Church Slavonic, Indonesian, Katharevousa, Guarani or Bokmål, although I certainly do not have the expertise to debate how to classify any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="530" LastEditorUserId="530" LastEditDate="2018-05-01T21:07:42.360" LastActivityDate="2018-05-01T21:07:42.360" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Some languages are easier/simpler regarding some features (English inflectional morphology), but make up for that in others (vast number of near-synonyms with different distributional characteristics in English). Toki Pona is a very simple language (120 words, virtually no syntactic complexity), so you can learn it almost in a day, but it is very hard to express complicated narratives, and an equivalent text in a more complex language would be far more concise. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Learning Esperanto is reasonably easy, but then you look at how people actually use it in everyday interactions, and you find that it is more difficult than you imagined: there are a lot of the smaller particles that make it tricky to understand for a beginner. But the 'early' sentences composed when the language was still fairly new are a lot simpler.

Languages like French are spoken both on the street and in high society, so there are multiple registers. It’s an introductory language for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slang is often used to exclude; if you’re not “one of us” but you still&#xA;Speak the language, you still are on the outside because you can’t quite follow what’s being said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A language like Quechua in South America (according to Nick) doesn’t develop slang because speaking it is already a marker for being low-status socially (vs Spanish speakers). Speaking Quechua already excludes those on the other end of the linguistic divide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Belter is similar. Nobody but Belters speak it (maybe some inner intelligence officers do, the way UK troops would learn Irish during the troubles. Speaking Belter is a mark of low social status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nick has said that he would imagine belters “fluidly speaking belt Lish. One can code shift on the fly between the two languages quite easily. If there amongst a bunch a rock hopper’s, they’ll probably all speak pure LB. When they’re on the docks, when there are more inners around, probably shift more towards English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Belters have to speak English to deal with the UN/MCRN tax&#xA;Collectors. When they get boarded by Mickie Marines, you BETTER speak English. When they deal with the any government office, it’ll be in English. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Haiti, the majority of the population are monolingual Kreyol speakers. But the language of Education and government forms is French. That leads to some fucked-up outcomes. I imagine Belter would be treated like Creole languages usually are; something broken &amp;amp; degenerate, not a real language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The correspondence courses Naomi took were almost certainly in English. Nobody is translating engineering textbooks into a “degenerate” language like a Creole, and nobody is teaching this classs in LB. Hinikirii Brown’s tablet on Anderson Station was in English, although he father spoke to her mostly in LB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Miller is a perfect example of code shifting. Watch his hands throughout the seasons; for a “welwala”, he is the most hand-gesturing Belter on Ceres. When interviewing Gia (who has just had a client murdered in her room), he interviews her in LB to set her at ease. But when talking to the Governor’s agent about the water thieves, he speaks perfect English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prax is an educated Belter. You don’t do botany classes in LB. and when he wakes up on the refugee ship, he first asks for Mei in English. When he realizes the crewman he’s speaking to is a Belter, Prax switches to LB. Prax spends so much time speaking English, shifting back into LB is something that takes a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, my feeling is the code shift mainly comes from “am I speaking to a Belter, or an Inner?” The inner/Belter dichotomy is cooked into LB down to the level of pronouns the way social hierarchy is cooked into Japanese. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Beltalowda” is the plural pronoun for “Belters” with the connotation of both “all Belters” as well as “us Belters” ( becaus again, almost nobody outside Belters speaks LB). “Inyalowda” is both “all inners” [No distinction between Earther or Martian], and “You inners”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="545" LastActivityDate="2018-04-30T01:05:33.280" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This literally &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; fit the SAE but doesn't act like the SAE languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;✓ Anticausative Preference&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preferences are up to the speakers. I'm not a speaker but I'd say there is a preference for anticausatives over causatives, especially since many Esperanto speakers are European and copy their preferences to Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;✓ Dative External Possession&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses dative external possession, especially in translations where another language, with dative external possession, is translated to Esperanto. This fits the SAE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;✓ Comparative particle&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses the particle &lt;em&gt;ol&lt;/em&gt; 'than' for comparatives. &lt;em&gt;Ol&lt;/em&gt; comes from German &lt;em&gt;als&lt;/em&gt; 'than', also a comparative particle. This fits SAE perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;✓ Relative Clause Based Equative Construction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses &lt;em&gt;tiel ... kiel&lt;/em&gt; for 'as ... as' relative-clause based equative constructions. Literally, that is 'so (in that manner) ... how/as (relatively used: in what manner, in which manner)'. This fits SAE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;✓ Reflexive and Intensifier Pronoun&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto doesn't have a form like the English 'himself' and uses &lt;em&gt;mem&lt;/em&gt; 'self'. This is the root of 'himself'. &lt;em&gt;Lin mem&lt;/em&gt; 'himself' is literally 'him self'. The reflexive is different, Esperanto uses &lt;em&gt;si&lt;/em&gt;.

See the literature on language death for more about that process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rich vocabulary is hard&lt;/strong&gt;. Teachers of languages say that the shear amount of vocabulary you need to learn is a major barrier to learning a language. This is why auxlangs try to pick words that are highly similar to what someone already knows. toki pona takes the idea of vocabulary reduction to about as far as it can go, but in my experience with it, it still feels like you need to memorize about 3000 set phrases whose meaning can't easily be guessed from the parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphology is hard&lt;/strong&gt;.

Definite and indefinite articles - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto defies SAE norms out the gate here, as it &lt;strong&gt;only has a definite article&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;libro&lt;/em&gt; - &quot;a book&quot;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;la libro&lt;/em&gt; - &quot;the book&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is actually quite bizarre, as those SAE languages that do not fit this criterion (such as Slavic languages, which heavily influenced Esperanto) have no articles at all. However, some neighboring non-SAE languages do have only a definite article, so this isn't too bizarre cross-linguistically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haspelmath characterizes this way of forming relative clauses, unique to SAE languages, by the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The relative clause is post-nominal&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is an inflecting relative pronoun&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This pronoun introduces the relative clause&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The relative pronoun functions as a resumptive, signalling the head's role in the relative clause.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto relative clauses &lt;strong&gt;fit all of these criteria&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiu blua balono, &lt;strong&gt;kion&lt;/strong&gt; mi estis tenanta, knalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &quot;That blue balloon, which I was holding, popped.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, the relative clause &lt;em&gt;kion mi estis tenanta&lt;/em&gt; follows the nominal head &lt;em&gt;balono&lt;/em&gt;. It is introduced by an inflecting relative pronoun &lt;em&gt;kion&lt;/em&gt;, which is inflected for the accusative case to mark the balloon's role in the clause (that it is the object of &lt;em&gt;estas tenanta&lt;/em&gt;. Pretty much prototypical SAE here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;3. 'Have'-perfect - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many European languages used a form of &quot;to have&quot; plus a passive participle to mark what we can loosely call the perfect. The languages that possess this construction have grammaticalized it to different degrees, but according to Haspelmath, &quot;what is important here is that they all must have had basically the same meaning when they were first created.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;does not have a 'have'-perfect&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, Esperanto emulates Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages in using &quot;to be&quot; + an active participle -- a form Haspelmath explicitly contrasts with the 'have'-perfect in his article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi estas vidinta la viron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi est-as vid-i-nta          la  vir-on&#xA;I  be-PRS see-PERF-ACT.PTCP  the man-ACC&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have seen the man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprising given Zamenhof's language background, but not SAE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;4. Nominative experiencers - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &quot;verbs of sensation, emotion, cognition, and perception,&quot; there are two main strategies for expressing the experiencer -- either the experiencer is treated like an agent and marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;I like it&quot;), or it is treated like a patient or goal and the stimulus is marked as a nominative subject (e.g., &quot;It pleases me&quot;, &quot;It is pleasing to me&quot;). English pretty much exclusively uses nominative experiencers, but this isn't strictly binary across languages -- many languages, including quite a few SAE languages, will have some verbs that do the former and some that do the latter. However, most SAE languages have a very strong tendency to prefer nominative experiencers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;primarily uses nominative experiencers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi vidis fantomon.&lt;/em&gt; - &quot;I saw a ghost.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi timas la mallumon.&lt;/em&gt; - &quot;I fear the darkness.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi flaras florojn.&lt;/em&gt; - &quot;I smell flowers.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto does possess at least one verb that bucks the trend, &lt;em&gt;plaĉi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ĉokolado plaĉas al mi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &quot;I like chocolate&quot; (lit., &quot;Chocolate is pleasing to me.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even this construction is gradually becoming less used over time as speakers favor the nominative experiencer verb &lt;em&gt;ŝati&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi ŝatas ĉokoladon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &quot;I like chocolate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Esperanto is pretty SAE in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;5. Participial passive - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote Haspelmath: &quot;Standard Average European languages typically have a canonical passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb (&quot;be&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, or the like). In this passive the original direct object becomes the subject and the original subject may be omitted, but it may also be expressed as an adverbial agent phrase.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto passives behave pretty much exactly in this way.&lt;/strong&gt; Unsurprising, since none of the language families from which it draws its inspiration differ from the SAE trend here either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La knabo estas batita (de sia fratino).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;la  knab-o  est-as bat-i-ta           de si-a      frat-in-o&#xA;the boy-NOM be-PRS hit-PERF-PASS.PTCP of REFL-POSS brother-FEM-NOM&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The boy is hit (by his sister).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Granted, these passive participle constructions in Esperanto can often be avoided using anticausitive morphology or free word order in contexts where this type of passive construction would be unavoidable in, say, English. But this construction exists and is certainly frequently used enough to be considered a nicely SAE feature of Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;6. Anticausative prominence - ?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto possesses both a causative affix &lt;em&gt;-ig&lt;/em&gt; and an anticausative affix &lt;em&gt;-iĝ&lt;/em&gt;, both of which are used very frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fand-i           fand-iĝ-i          brul-i             brul-ig-i&#xA;melt-INF         melt-ANTIC-INF     burn-INF           burn-CAUS-INF&#xA;&quot;to melt (tr.)&quot;  &quot;to melt (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (intr.)&quot;  &quot;to burn (tr.)&quot;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To say for certain that Esperanto has a preference for one over the other, some proper analysis of the language's vocabulary and usage would have to be done. In my limited experience, I'd say that they're about equally common in Esperanto, but it's really not possible to say without a lot more research into Esperanto verbs and their usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;7. Dative external possessors - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @jknappen has pointed out, Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;does allow for dative external possessors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi lavas &lt;strong&gt;al mi&lt;/strong&gt; la manoj.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &quot;I wash my hands.&quot; (literally, &quot;I wash to me the hands&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't personally speak for how common they are, but the only requirement for this criterion is that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;8. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is another easy one, as this SAE feature is &lt;strong&gt;explicitly spelled out in the basic 16 rules of Esperanto:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When another NEGATIVE word is present, the word NE [English no, not] is omitted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Mi ne  venis     Neniu  venis    &#xA;  I  not come      No.one comes&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;9. Particles in comparative constructions - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few ways of marking comparatives, but particle comparatives like the English &quot;than&quot; are pretty overwhelmingly SAE. Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;uses a particle comparative&lt;/strong&gt;, as its &lt;em&gt;ol&lt;/em&gt; is pretty much identical in function to English &quot;that&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;10. Relative-based equative constructions - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto's equative construction &lt;em&gt;tiel ... kiel&lt;/em&gt; is actually more &lt;strong&gt;transparently based on relative clauses&lt;/strong&gt; than the English construction, as it uses synchronic relative correlatives -- and even the English &quot;as ... as&quot; construction is considered relative-based by Haspelmath. Another transparently SAE feature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;11. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's far more common, cross-linguistically, for languages with person-marking to be pro-drop. However, several SAE languages (including French, German, and English) inflect the verb to agree with the person/number of the subject &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; allowing the subject to be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While Esperanto is not pro-drop, to my knowledge, &lt;strong&gt;Esperanto does not inflect verbs to agree with the person or number of the subject&lt;/strong&gt;, and so it avoids this SAE feature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;12. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;European languages verb frequently distinguish between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns, but using one form for both appears to be more common worldwide. English actually averts this, as it uses its reflexive in this intensifier function (e.g., &quot;He did it himself&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto's intensifier particle, &lt;em&gt;mem&lt;/em&gt;, is distinct from its reflexive pronoun &lt;em&gt;si&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li batis sin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &quot;He hit himself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li mem batis ĝin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &quot;He hit it himself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, Esperanto is SAE in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="52" LastEditorUserId="52" LastEditDate="2018-05-07T15:19:51.023" LastActivityDate="2018-05-07T15:19:51.023" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

They were used on different parts of the set, with the more logographic script occurring in a lot of the more traditional contexts and the alphabet occurring more widely throughout the set.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/wakandan.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Omniglot page&lt;/a&gt; for the script includes text written in both English and Xhosa using the script, but the Xhosa text seems transliterated from the romanized orthography for Xhosa. That said, since the author described the alphabetic script as a &quot;more evolved&quot; version of the logography, it's possible that it was deliberately designed to be similar to the Latin transliteration of Xhosa? Granted, that doesn't seem particularly in-character for the Wakanda depicted in the film, but who knows. Perhaps we'll learn more about the script in the inevitable sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that the alphabetic script is not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; used to transliterate English as it is in the title cards.

Even within the same language, often some borrowed words will be more integrated into the language than others. The more recently a word was borrowed, the more speakers of the language will treat it as a &quot;foreign&quot; word and be willing to make exceptions for it, but as its use becomes more and more common, speakers will inevitably begin to treat it as a native word if it doesn't fall out of use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word take on the conjugation/declension pattern of destlang?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, sometimes not. There are examples of both in natlangs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The English verb &quot;to google&quot; has been borrowed into many languages, and it seems to typically conform to the conjugation patterns of those languages. Even in Japanese, a language with a famously closed class of verbs, borrowed &quot;to google&quot; as a verb ググる(it may have become a verb after being borrowed as a noun, but either way, it's quite remarkable).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet it's also possible for exceptions to be made. This happens with some English noun borrowings (most English speakers won't try to pluralize &lt;em&gt;edamame&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; with English plural morphology), but not with others (many English speakers will pluralize &lt;em&gt;zucchini&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;zucchinis&lt;/em&gt;, and you'll pretty much never heard &lt;em&gt;zucchino&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, verbs are more likely to take on the native conjugation patterns than nouns are native declension patterns, but I don't have any data to back that up cross-linguistically. A borrowed word &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; definitely more likely to be conjugated or declined like a native one the longer it has been in the language (the pedantry about pluralizing Latin borrowings in English is an exception to this, but that's more because of the social prestige associated with having studied Latin).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word get re-spelled to conform to destlang’s orthographical conventions?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This really is a case-by-case thing. If the language uses a completely different writing system, almost definitely, but sometimes the orthographical conventions won't be the same as native words. Japanese uses katakana for borrowings, for instance, and English borrowings from Japanese and Chinese tend to follow whatever romanization scheme was most popular when they were borrowed, even if the pronunciation is pretty opaque. For instance, the Chinese word 道 was borrowed as &quot;Tao&quot; in English based on older Chinese romanizations, even though the Chinese word now romanized as &lt;em&gt;dào&lt;/em&gt; and the English derived word &quot;Taoism&quot; is more often pronounced /ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/ in English (though a spelling pronunciation /ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/ has arisen due to this).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word’s pronunciation get changed to conform to destlang’s phonemic conventions (e.g., elimination of consonant blends, all syllables must end in a vowel, etc.)?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost always yes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While sometimes educated speakers or upper-class speakers will try to pronounce a borrowed word with its &quot;original pronunciation&quot; rather than its borrowed one (&quot;gyro&quot; is a good example of this), even those pronunciations are almost always somewhat changed to fit the destlang's phonology better, and often they aren't even closer to the pronunciation in the sourcelang. How exactly the word is altered to fit the destlang's phonology depends on the particulars of the borrowing situation, however.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What sort of methods exist for choosing which words to borrow? What causes a “native” word to fall out of use in favor of a borrowing, or, contrariwise, why would both the “native” word and the borrowed word stay in use?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've combined these questions because I feel there's a lot of overlap in the answers. Often, words are borrowed to fill a semantic gap in the destlang, which is why words for new technologies are so often borrowed (think of how many languages borrowed the word &quot;television&quot;!) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Borrowings are also often used to refer to the &quot;versions&quot; of certain things from the part of the world that speaks that language -- consider how &lt;em&gt;anime&lt;/em&gt;, a generic word for all animation in Japanese, was borrowed into English as a word for a style of Japanese animation, or how English borrowed &quot;chai&quot; from the Hindi/Urdu word for tea, चाय (cāy) / چای‎ (ćāy) to refer to tea with certain spices based on Indian recipes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, sometimes words are borrowed because they carry some social value seen attractive by the speakers of destlang. Maybe destlang speakers think sourcelang sounds refined and sophisticated, and so upper-class destlang speakers borrow words from sourcelang to sound fancy. Of course, this sort of situation depends on a lot of social and sociopolitical factors wherever the languages are spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="52" LastActivityDate="2018-05-22T20:22:44.247" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Their son Ittamar Ben-Avi, born in 1882, would later recall that he was sent to his room whenever any guests came over who did not speak Hebrew, so he would not hear another language, and that his father became enraged when he caught his mother singing lullabies to him in her native Russian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="530" LastActivityDate="2018-06-22T01:18:32.163" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Despite the diversity in our world, I've found it surprisingly hard to find a multitude of systems to draw from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is: writing systems have different factors that can influence their design. Syllabraries tend to have more complex characters than alphabets, because they don't have to write as many of them to spell out a word. And besides, they need a wider diversity of symbols anyway. Logographic systems are no different. Also the medium makes a huge difference. The aesthetic of one script may not be too practical to replicate using a medium it wasn't intended for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've found this all divides up writing systems into multiple different categories based on design. This means that if you stick with a certain medium and type of writing system, you won't have much to go off of. Like, if you look at alphabets, all that really seems to be out there is Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Korean. And if you look at cursive scripts, you only really have two options: English cursive, and Arabic, which is technically an abjad. And of course if you want a logographic system, the only living logographic system (aka, the only one to see use in a world where literacy was normal writing was part of every day life) is Chinese. Beyond that, all you have to look at are long extinct logographic systems that were all made to be carved into stone. Or cuneiform, which used some rather odd tools and medium to write. How many systems do you know of that were written in clay, and were always stamped rather than drawn?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't come up with forms that really look overly different from the few alphabets currently in use. Worse yet, most of them are closely related to each other! It seems like every symbol possible has already been used in a writing system somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that has really helped me is I've noticed that most lower-case Latin letters are built from a limited number of shapes: a circle, loop, short line, long line, long line with a loop, and a dot.

Yes, aspect isn't mentioned in the 16 Rules. However, this clearly doesn't mean Esperanto completely lacks aspect -- the 16 Rules are not intended to be a linguistically rigorous analysis of Esperanto, but merely a set of easy rules to teach laymen. Zamenhof definitely designed Esperanto containing some aspectual markers, especially given the amount of influence he took from Slavic languages; what is unclear is exactly &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; aspectual information he intended to be encoded in certain markers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on your description of Esperanto's complex tenses and your claim that &quot;these aspects do not even occur in a pure form in English&quot;, you seem to be under the impression that to truly be present in a language, an aspect must be marked by a single morpheme rather than through syntactic constructions like the verb + participle constructions in English and Esperanto &quot;complex tenses.&quot; However, that isn't how that works. The English present/past continuous constructions do mark progressive/continuous aspect. The English present/past perfect constructions do mark the perfect, though &quot;perfect&quot; is a bit more of a complex mix of tense and aspect than it is pure aspect. The fact that certain syntactic constructions are used here rather than a single affix does not make the aspectual marking here any less &quot;pure&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There actually has historically been some debate over how Esperanto participles mark aspect when used in complex tenses. Zamenhof himself saw Esperanto participles as marking a mixture of tense and aspect, and this resulted in a divide among Esperantists regarding whether to translate, say &quot;The house was built long ago&quot; with &lt;em&gt;estis konstruata&lt;/em&gt; (because the participle happens at the same time as the main verb) or with &lt;em&gt;estis konstruita&lt;/em&gt; (as the building is accomplished and focused on describing its result). The latter group largely won out with an un-official notice from the Academy in 1965, which gave the following positions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Esperanto tense system consists of but three tenses: the present, the past, and the future.    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;All other time relationships (such as the pluperfect, future perfect, etc. of many other languages) are expressed by adverbs, conjunctions, or simply by context.    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The six participles, used either with nouns or with the verb esti, show aspect, not tense. They show, in other words, in what phase of the action the subject finds himself with respect to the object: whether beginning and unfinished (-ant, -at), finished and fulfilled (-int, -it), or not yet begun but intended or awaited (-ont, -ot).   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Accordingly the forms with -ata focus upon the duration or repetition of the act, and the forms with -ita focus upon the result of the act. The forms with -ita can also show priority in time in the event that there is separate evidence of that in the sentence, such as a word like jam = “already.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Quoted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/eo/colloq/colloq200.html#sec20-2&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Being Colloquial in Esperanto's Appendix on Participles&lt;/a&gt;, which goes into more detail about the conflict here.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this treatment of Esperanto participles are markers exclusively of aspect is technically not an official order from the Academy, it has generally been treated as such my most Esperantists, and this is largely how Esperantists use participles -- the &lt;em&gt;-anta/-ata&lt;/em&gt; participles marking the continuous/progressive, the &lt;em&gt;-inta/-ita&lt;/em&gt; participles marking the resultative, and the &lt;em&gt;-onta/-ota&lt;/em&gt; participles marking the prospective.

Likewise, if it has a voiced plosive, it'll probably have other voiced consonants, possibly of other points of articulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this just the majority of the time. English, for instance has only one palatal consonant (the 'y' sound) and only one lateral (our 'l'). Though few languages have more than one lateral consonant (assuming they have any at all), and 'y' is the only common palatal consonant. All the others are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There, however, a few universals. All languages have voiceless stops. They may only have one (and there are that do), but they will always have one. Also, all languages have monophthongs. So that means that there aren't any natural language out there that only have diphthongs for vowels. Note however, that diphthongs in a language can be made up of monophthongs that don't exist in the language. Take note that the English 'o' sound is actually a diphthong. English doesn't have the monophthong 'o' for some reason. This is why books that teach you foreign languages often tell you cut off the last part of the 'o' sound. What they're actually trying to get you to do is not do the off-glide that our 'o' normally has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that though, there are no universals. No one phone is found in all languages. And exactly how many phonemes a language has varies widely. The most common is 5 vowels (the standard 5-vowel array you see everywhere) and 20 to 25 consonants. But there's languages with only half a dozen consonants, and others that have dozens. Then there's the case of Ubykh, which not only has dozens of consonants but only contains 2 vowels, which are of course prone to considerable allophony. In general, its hard to find languages that have fewer than 5 vowels, but they do exist. Several native languages up in Canada only have 4 vowels. The Semitic languages only have 3 vowels (well, modern Arabic also has 2 diphtongs, and its three monophthongs distinguish length, though classical Arabic only had 3 monophthongs, I don't know about Hebrew).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user348" LastActivityDate="2018-07-15T06:06:55.297" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

To indicate other tenses (preterite/past imperfect/subjunctive/future/etc) I use the combined phrase &amp;quot;sona,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;in (the) time (of)&amp;quot; and then adding a various suffix to indicate the specific tense(&amp;quot;sonasato&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;in time past&amp;quot;).

However, I still believe that we can come up with language features that make a language easy to learn in general. To measure this, you would want to take the number of hours it takes to achieve a certain level of proficiency in a target language from 50 source languages (the languages with the most speakers). After this come up with an average by weighting the numbers based on number of speakers. A language with an average of 456 hours would be easier to learn for the average person than a language with an average of 678 hours. This is of course not a method of deriving 'absolute' difficulty but it's good enough for what I want. Now, actually running this experiment would take a lot of time but for now it's good as a thought experiment to figure out what the goal is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trying to get the sounds right in a new language can be very time consuming.

Toki Pona has nine consonants p, t, k, s, m, n, l, j, w and five vowels a, e, i, o, u. Not only are these very common phonemes but there is also the added benefit that there are no voiced/voiceless pairs. The reason this is useful is because it helps people whose language contains only one of the voiced or voiceless forms of a consonant. As an example, Arabic has no 'p' sound and therefore when they see the world 'pala' in a theoretical easy language they might pronounce it as 'bala'. Since there is no 'b' sound people will recognize that they are saying 'pala'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having a vocabulary that everyone would recognize would be useful but it's unfortunately not possible. The best attempts at creating such a vocabulary would only be useful for around 15 percent of the world's population. Add to this the fact that phonology is more important, and using the simplified phonology, you would not even be able to mimic a lot of the vocabulary from a natural language. However, there are still some things that would help make a language's vocabulary easier to learn: avoiding homonyms, making common words short, constructing words to be easy to pronounce (ex. avoiding complex consonant clusters).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been proven that phonetic writing systems are easier to learn than logographic systems. Between phonetic writing systems (alphabet, abugida, abjad) it's less clear what the easier to learn system is. However, it doesn't really matter due to the overwhelming adoption of the Latin script world wide (70% of the world's population use it). Even in places where the native language does not use the Latin script people will still have significant exposure to it. Because of this an easy to learn language should use the Latin script. The words should also be completely phonetic in their spelling. This allows learners to read, pronounce, and spell any word without having to memorize a bunch of spelling rules and exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one is self explanatory. A language that has regular grammar and no exceptions to its grammar rules is easier to learn. This should apply to all forms of grammar (inflections, word order, usages). As an example, if English were to always use -ed to make verbs past tense it would be easier to learn (swimmed, eated, falled).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Unnecessary Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as biological evolution has left human bodies with a large amount of inefficiencies, language evolution has left natural languages with a large amount of inefficiencies. It would take a long time to go through these as there are many, so I'll just use the gender example from the question. As jknappen said in the comments grammatical genders do have a small amount of communicative power in that they can, on occasion, avoid ambiguity of two things. However, this only happens when there are two things potentially being referred to, when it's not clear based on context which thing is being referred to, and when the two things are different genders. Example from Wikipedia: &quot;a flowerbed in the garden which I maintain&quot; vs &quot;ein Blumenbeet im Garten, das ich pflege&quot;. This is very rare and not useful enough to merit spending a significant amount of time learning genders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="740" LastActivityDate="2018-08-02T17:45:09.010" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

My question is this: &lt;strong&gt;Is there an advantageous method to sort and organize characters of a logographic system, specifically for &lt;em&gt;dictionary look-up&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Given the properties I mentioned above.)&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My current method is just sorting by the &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of ideas. Ex.: In the verb category, I may sort verbs whether they describe &lt;em&gt;positional&lt;/em&gt; things, e.g., &lt;em&gt;to be underneath&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;motional&lt;/em&gt; things, e.g., &lt;em&gt;to run&lt;/em&gt;, etc. For nouns, a similar system may be employed (haven't reached this point yet), as well as for adjectives.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I imagine that such an approach would/could create confusion. (Is an ice cream cake a cake or an ice cream? Why?)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, there must be other options I'm not seeing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/250&quot;&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt;, for example, seems to brush the idea just a smidgen, but it is centered largely on computer programs for organization. &lt;strong&gt;For this&lt;/strong&gt;, I should specify that I am working entirely &lt;em&gt;on-paper&lt;/em&gt;.

Depending on whether the glottis is active, these sounds can be classified as voiced or unvoiced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The former are called vowels: they are always voiced, and are defined through the positions of jaw and tongue.

We usually learn the two together, and thus learn the mapping between them. These can vary in how obvious they are. At one extreme are languages that use a very standard mapping. It is virtually impossible to be able to read the Roman alphabet - in English or French, say, and to be able to speak Portuguese, but not to be able to read Portuguese, as a friend of mine found out. She had these skills but had never learnt to read Portuguese. Her mum was shocked to find her reading a book in Portuguese and asked where she learnt to do that. She had not learnt - she could just do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step is English or Gaelic (and not many other languages) where the mapping is so poor that it is possible to be fluent in the spoken language, and not to be able to read the language, even though you can read another language in the same alphabet. 100 years ago there was a famous disaster involving a ship called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMY_Iolaire&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Iolaire&lt;/a&gt;. Virtually everyone on board, and the bereaved relatives, had Gaelic as a first language, but they could not read Gaelic and so had no idea the ship's name was Gaelic - they pronounced it as an English person would and had no idea what the name meant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next come languages like Chinese, which is in fact several spoken languages, with one written language. The symbol 米 means rice. How you pronounce it varies according to whether you speak Mandarin or Cantonese, or even Japanese which sometimes uses Chinese symbols (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kanji&lt;/a&gt;). Thus you can learn written Mandarin (you now know one word) with no clue as to how to pronounce it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We use some logograms in English. Some, such as ☏, are pictographic in origin, and so have no inherent pronunciation - we just translate them to English as we read them. Others, such as &amp;amp;, are alphabetic in origin. This one is a fancy way to write &lt;em&gt;et&lt;/em&gt;, which is Latin or French for &quot;and&quot;. We ignore this and just pronounce it &quot;and&quot;. Of course other people, such as the Germans, will pronounce these symbols differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could always learn a natural or constructed language from a book that had no pronunciation guide, if it was written in Cyrillic, using Chinese characters, or using its own made-up logograms. But of course, you could find out how to pronounce it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, a language could be constructed without a vocal form. I am not aware that this has occurred. The problem here is that there is no way stop someone inventing a vocal form for each symbol. This is a bit like learning Old English or Ancient Greek.

The resulting grammar would of course still be valid. However, you want to make such changes very rare and slow.

For example, if you're creating a Slavic language, you could easily use the Cyrillic or Latin scripts (cf. Russian, Czech); there's no need to design a new script.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What do geographically or lexically similar languages use as their primary scripts? Finnish uses the Latin script as a result of Swedish influence, even though Swedish is not related to Finnish linguistically.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How does the language intersect with the culture of the people speaking it? Although Serbian and Croatian are technically the same language, they typically use different writing systems because Serbians tend to be Orthodox (Cyrillic-associated) and Croatians tend to be Catholic (Latin-associated). Conversely, Cantonese uses the same script as Mandarin despite not being the same language due to geographical and political similarities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When did your language and its script split off from its ancestors, and how were they written? Despite Greek not being a Semitic language, it had a close proximity to the Phoenicians and thus borrowed their alphabet. But if your language came more recently, perhaps you should base it upon a more recent alphabet such as Greek itself, or even the Latin script (as with Lisu).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How strict is your language phonologically, and what semantic effect does changing vowels or consonants have? Arabic uses an abjad in part because the consonants provide the actual base meaning, while vowels change various minutiae, while Japanese (in part) can use a syllabary because it's very restrictive with syllable structure. On the other hand, Georgian uses a full alphabet because it has so many consonant clusters, which can't really be expressed concisely in a syllabary or abugida.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; you can consider how you want it to look. You can give something a more cursive or angular appearance while still basing it off of something relevant. This also gives it more of a unique flavor even if you're using an existing system. This is something you could do for a Phoenician-based system that doesn't look like Phoenician (crude, but you get the point):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtpJI.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtpJI.png&quot; alt=&quot;Phoenician aleph; on the right is a symbol that looks like a reversed Latin thorn.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should additionally think about the direction in which your script is supposed to be written - letter forms can change based on that. They tend to lean right in an LTR script and vice versa, and be either thin and tall or confined to a square for a vertical script (like traditional Mongolian/Uyghur and Chinese hànzì respectively). Also, vertical scripts don't often have completely open bottoms or tops of characters like LTR scripts might.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a fantasy world, where you're relying less on historicity and looking more for inspiration, you kind of just need to look at different scripts applying the sort of aesthetic you want, then alter them and perhaps combine them together into a whole system. If you enjoy neat and somewhat simplistic scripts with varying letter heights, you could combine inspiration from Latin and Armenian. For loopy, natural-looking scripts, take a look at Georgian and Greek.

All languages (previously) in existence are in essence linear, because they are phonetic representations of human experience. Even when describing the past or the future, language does so in a linear form. Also, any human language is itself subject to time, with one phoneme uttered after another. In addition, the grammars of some languages are very restrictive to allow expression of effect preceding cause, etc. For example, Indo-Germanic languages cannot have verbs without a subject and the subject must precede the verb. So looking at natural languages it is clear that some are better suited to express time paradoxes etc. than others. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably the best candidate languages to extend or base a &lt;em&gt;conlang&lt;/em&gt; on would be those languages that do not change sentence structure for singular vs plural, present vs past or future, affirmative vs negative, certain vs conditional, etc. Japanese for example would be a good candidate. To change all of the aforementioned sentence parameters you would just use suffixes, e.g. &lt;em&gt;-ta&lt;/em&gt; for past tense, &lt;em&gt;-tachi&lt;/em&gt; for plural, &lt;em&gt;-yo&lt;/em&gt; for conditional, etc. It could therefore easily be extended with suffixes to express time paradoxes, timelines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another language that meets the conditions of unchanging sentence structure related to time &amp;amp; conditions would be Chinese (Literary Chinese to be exact, Modern Chinese would be a bit more problematic due to its compound phrases).

This is a choice, and by no means a necessity.

Certainly not: auxiliary languages often take heavy inspiration from existing languages, as familiarity makes it easier to learn a language.

Here I am inclined to say &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;. If you simply copy an English dictionary and replace all the words by other sounding words, then you’ve created what is called a &lt;em&gt;relex&lt;/em&gt;. Whether relexes are considered conlangs or not is up for debate, in my eyes they are ciphers. However, there’s layers upon layers to this - is a conlang still a relex if you copy the lexicon but use completely different grammar? Perhaps not, but it’s not as interesting as if you also made a custom lexicon. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that doing so takes away most of what makes a conlang unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to follow the idea of having sentences broken down into words? Absolutely not: it’s actually surprisingly hard (read: an unsolved problem) to define the concept of a word in a way that works for every language. Look into the (just as loosely defined) concept of polysynthesis if you’re intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Language doesn’t have to rely on sound. There’s sign languages as a primary counterexample that also shows up “in real life”, and on top of that, graphical (written only), touch based and many other kinds of languages have been created. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But let’s assume you’re going to be making a spoken language. Two questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to make &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; sounds? Well… no. There’s only so many sounds our mouths can make and most of them already occur in some language (and those that don’t, e.g. smacking ones teeth together don’t occur for good reasons), so it’s rather hard to even &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; new sounds. But if you’re making a language meant for aliens/sapient animals/whatever nonhuman you can come up with, then maybe you might want to. But many conlangers don’t bother, as it is &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to make a new sound system or can I just use the sounds of English/other language? Same point as with the words above: You don’t have to, and if your goal is to focus on other parts of the conlang you might as well ignore it, but if your goal is to make a good, interesting and unique conlang, then… yea you should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, what you do and don’t do depends entirely on your design goals. If you wanna toy with a particular grammar concept, then focus on the essentials. If you wanna make the new big international auxlang then keep things familiar to the target audience. If you want to make a natural looking conlang, then go all in and be creative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="53" LastActivityDate="2018-12-09T11:52:17.207" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If there are multiple clauses in a complex sentence, you will need to mark the clause boundaries in some way, eg through punctuation or use of specific conjunctions. So you can put anything in that place, and it will be interpreted as a verb: &lt;em&gt;'Ono&lt;/em&gt; means &quot;delicious&quot; as an adjective, in &lt;em&gt;'Ono ka hua moa&lt;/em&gt; it is used as a verb to mean &quot;the egg is delicious&quot;. That also might solve problems when you later grow your lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markers: In toki pona, the verb is always in second position in a clause, and is separated from the subject (which is in first position) through the particle &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. So the sentence &lt;em&gt;waso li lape&lt;/em&gt; can be parsed as &lt;em&gt;waso&lt;/em&gt; - subject, &lt;em&gt;lape&lt;/em&gt; - verb, even if you have no clue what the words actually mean (&quot;bird&quot; and &quot;to sleep&quot; respectively) Note: the personal pronouns &lt;em&gt;mi&lt;/em&gt; ans &lt;em&gt;sina&lt;/em&gt; are an exception to this rule, as they are not followed by &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Lape&lt;/em&gt; can also be a noun (&quot;the sleep&quot;). Transitive verbs are separated by &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; from the object, which again helps identifying the sentence structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morphology: if you want to avoid repetitive sounds, you can nominate different verb endings (or prefixes) to either introduce variation for variation's sake, or to indicate other features (number, tense, aspect, modality, ...) While Esperanto uses a limited set of verb endings indicating (mostly) tense, it does not sound repetitive. If your verbs are not marked for grammatical features, morphology obviously is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="307" LastActivityDate="2019-02-19T09:35:51.847" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Rosenfelder describes the book as &quot;a tour of modern syntax&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a linguist myself, it looks like the book I'd loved to have had while at university. It covers (English) syntactic theory in a way that looks interesting and not simply dry and theoretical -- he supplements the book by a set of interactive tools to develop your own grammars based on the theoretical ideas of Chomsky and others. He does follow a particular strand of syntactic theory, which is mainly common in the US, not so much in the UK, but he also covers some alternatives to the Chomskyan approach. Rosenfelder's own view of Chomsky is nuanced and somewhat sceptical: he has an essay on this on his website (which I wholeheartedly agree with). Note, however, that this is about English, and these formalisms have been developed by linguists working mostly with English, so if your conlang is very different, they might not easily apply to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Chomskyan &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Generative Grammar&lt;/a&gt;, he also talks about &lt;a href=&quot;http://zompist.com/markov.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Markov text generators&lt;/a&gt;, which would be useful to generate (random) texts in a given language. This might be a useful tool to practically explore your conlang: generate some text, and try to translate it. Several other tools are also aimed at generating sentences, rather than just analysing them. The meaning is often a bit random (as it is not really controlled), but at least the grammar will be correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is basically a syntax textbook, which will introduce you to syntactic theories while playing around with the formalisms and actively doing syntax (which to me is the best way of learning about them!) If you are interested in grammar, and the formal properties of different types of grammars, this looks like an ideal book. In fact, I have put it on my wishlist with a well-known on-line book retailer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if all you want to do is build a smallish conlang, which might not even have a very complicated grammar, then this book looks like overkill to me. On the site he mentions that there is &quot;a chapter on how you can apply all this to your conlangs&quot;. So conlangs are not really the focus of the book, but more a possible application of the described syntactic apparatus to invented languages. I would assume -- from the description on the webpage -- that this is a fairly advanced book, which is great for linguistics students and  for serious conlangers who want to make use of sophisticated formalisms when describing their languages. In that sense it will not cover too much of the same ground as his more 'applied'/'practical' books about language creation. If the previous books have kindled an interest in linguistics, though, and you want to know more about approaches to syntactic description, then this might be the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="307" LastActivityDate="2019-04-05T08:47:48.063" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you want to be able to emulate all the words of real languages, add the whole IPA system. If you want nice melodic options, add in accordance with your preferred music system (Asian 5 tone, Western 7 tone, Modern 12 tone, each with steps and variations, and repeating form 20 Hz up to 20 000 Hz) and for each possible sound humans can produce - different voiced and voiceless sounds, whispered (ha) or normal (a), and so on. If you want to actually use it and keep it independent of other languages, I suggest keeping it simple - a movie language, for instance, is more effectful if you only choose in-character sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Btw, you get a lot more sounds even in English and Italian if you include unusual words, regional dialects and so on - a large part of the IPA phonemes can be used in either language, though people often don't notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here a few different English vowels (all mainstream):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hut&#xA;Hat&#xA;Heroic&#xA;Hellenic&#xA;Hmmmh&#xA;Hit&#xA;Here&#xA;Hot&#xA;Hotel&#xA;Herd&#xA;Hoover&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alpha&#xA;And&#xA;Entity&#xA;About&#xA;e-in-Garden&#xA;India&#xA;Equal&#xA;Oven&#xA;Organ&#xA;Earth&#xA;Ultra&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iron&#xA;Out&#xA;Able&#xA;Oil&#xA;Over&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi&#xA;How&#xA;Hey&#xA;Hoist&#xA;Holy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's 32 distinct sounds.

The e in &quot;Garden&quot; isn't a sound at all according to some. And so on. The version on Wikipedia (English phonology) is slightly different. &quot;Ha&quot; is even in IPA written as two sounds, though it clearly is one sound (a whispered &quot;a&quot;), as you can see when stretching it, with or without adding a letter afterwards. I even ommitted a few vowels only the British/Australian/Canadian people use. According to Google, US English has 14-16 vowel phonemes, Australian English 20-21. And the whispered variety isn't even included. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you multiply by three for tonal (add Up like we do in questions and Down like we do in some forms of emphasis or sounding defeated), you get 96. Asia also has a wavering tonal, but that can be emulated with two letters imo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you multiply by two for 2 different lengths, you get 192. If we ignore the h-sounds, we are still at 96.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what you have is not that much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="Carl Dombrowski" LastActivityDate="2019-04-06T00:15:43.450" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If your language has a syntax (and if it doesn't it really couldn't be considered language) then we'd expect that it would be possible to develop a tree-based representation of it, perhaps using multiple levels of deep structure below the surface. And a non-binary tree could be converted to a binary tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just spent some time looking at 2D languages, both conlangs and programming languages, and all the ones I found consisted of linear paths to follow or a tree structure. Conlangger Sai &lt;a href=&quot;https://s.ai/essays/nlf2dws&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;has explained their ideas for a non-linear fully 2D writing system&lt;/a&gt;, but they don't give an example of such a writing system.

It seems like it would be a natural step for the language to develop what I would call a voiced velopharyngeal stop occurring before those syllabic consonants are used some of the time, to add emphasis.  This stop is formed by stopping air from flowing into the nasal cavity with the velum while the mouth is in position to form the following consonant, and then releasing it into the nasal cavity.

The reason for this is that &quot;pi&quot; cannot be followed by a lone word, in this case &quot;wawa&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;[ pona sona pi [ wawa pi [ma Lipija ] ] ] - The intellect of the power of Libya&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;[ [ pona sona wawa ] pi [ ma Lipija ] ] - The strong intellect of Libya&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To say &quot;Libya's &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; of/concerning strength&quot;, it would likely be structured &quot;pona sona pi ma Lipija pi ijo wawa&quot; or &quot;pona sona pi ma Lipija pi wawa ijo&quot;, the second being a bit more on the mark (&quot;concerning strong things&quot; vs. &quot;concerning the strength of things&quot;).

There isn't a plosive-like sound for stopping air flowing through the nose, as there is with the mouth (in multiple places). The way you can test this is by producing a sound like /aãaãaãa/, in which you are repeatedly stopping the nasal airflow, and yet the vowel sound remains continuous because there is no stop of air in the mouth. So a stop created solely by blocking the nasal passage is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The example you give for this sound is [ĩɲ't̚?ⁿn̩], where the [?] is supposed to represent the unknown sound. This has a [t̚] with the diacritic for no release after the consonant, and a nasal release [ⁿ] after it. However, there can't possibly be anything between [t̚] and [ⁿ]. The [t̚] means that when the consonant ends, you are still blocking both oral and nasal airflow, and the [ⁿ] means that you are releasing nasal airflow while keeping oral airflow closed. There is no articulation possible in between these: if there were an oral release, the diacritic on [t̚] would have no meaning, and there could no longer be a nasal release [ⁿ] after it. The only possibility is to add another consonant, or extend the [t] as a long consonant [tː], which continues to block all airflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going through your definition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_release&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;nasal release&lt;/a&gt; seems to fit (another possibility that fits just as well is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-stopped_consonant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;pre-stopped nasal&lt;/a&gt;, if the nasal consonant is supposed to be more prominent than the stop):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This stop is formed by stopping air from flowing into the nasal cavity with the velum &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stopping airflow is a property of a stop consonant.

A Toki Pona clause can have more than one predicate. &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; never marks a non-predicate. It also appears on every predicate except when that predicate &lt;em&gt;is the first one in the clause and the subject is&lt;/em&gt; exactly &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;/em&gt; exactly &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;sina&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (101) or when preceded by the vocative/imperative particle &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; (102).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think a good way to analyze this would be to say that every indicative predicate obligatorily has a predicate marker, but sometimes it's null.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi  moku  li   pakala.

I haven't seen any examples of stacking imperative phrases, so I don't know whether &lt;em&gt;look and say&lt;/em&gt; would be &lt;code&gt;o lukin li toki&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;o lukin o toki&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, in Toki Pona verb phrases and noun phrases are different syntactically. For instance, &lt;code&gt;*sina moku e soweli ala soweli.&lt;/code&gt; cannot be used to mean &lt;em&gt;are you a vegetarian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LI        := 0 | &quot;li&quot;&#xA;PredInd   := LI VP {PP} | LI NP&#xA;ClauseInd := NP [PredInd]&#xA;PredImp   := &quot;o&quot; VP {PP} | &quot;o&quot; NP&#xA;ClauseImp := NP PredImp | PredImp&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not thrilled with this analysis because of the asymmetry between indicative and imperative clauses. Unifying the clause types, however, would predict that &lt;code&gt;*li moku.&lt;/code&gt; is valid. As far as I can tell, Toki Pona does not permit null subjects in indicative clauses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can think of two potential alternative analyses for &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt;: A) it's a pronoun (like in Example 4 Longgu &lt;a href=&quot;https://wals.info/chapter/101&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;on this WALS article&lt;/a&gt; or B) it's a preposition.

It predicts that &lt;code&gt;mi moku li pakala&lt;/code&gt; would be invalid and that the correct form would be &lt;code&gt;mi moku mi pakala&lt;/code&gt;. In reality, both forms are fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; as a pronoun also predicts that &lt;code&gt;*li moku&lt;/code&gt; would be valid since it would contain an explicit subject under that analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;code&gt;*mi moku li.&lt;/code&gt; cannot be used to mean &lt;em&gt;I eat it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B) &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; as preposition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; were a preposition, (103) and (104) would both be valid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mi pakala e moku.

An example for a human sublanguage would be the language of recipes. Words that have multiple meanings in English generally have only one specific meaning in a sublanguage. The syntactic structures are simplified, and often different from general English. Certain aspects of the range of human expressions are left out or limited (you might talk about emotions or feelings, but they would only relate to the food mentioned).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could design a programming language that is suited to expressing recipes, and it could be used to drive a cooking robot. That programming language could also be read by humans, who would understand the meaning of it, and could translate it into other languages. In this sense 'programming language' is a bit of a red herring: it's just a formal representation of meaning. And (propositional) meaning can easily be expressed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;predicate calculus&lt;/a&gt; or related formalisms.

But they might not be very suitable for inter-human communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could, though, envisage two people with no common language between them who use a programming language to work together on solving a problem. It would be tough, but should be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my view there is a continuum between 'fully formed' languages on the one hand, and restricted or sublanguages on the other. While it is difficult to formally represent the more complex languages (because they are so complex), the simpler end of the spectrum can be encoded in such a representation. Predicate calculus is one representation, and any programming language is another one. There is no hard boundary between the two, so in a way (even though nobody would really 'speak' in a programming language) the answer is: yes, programming languages can be categorised as conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="307" LastActivityDate="2019-08-19T16:51:09.063" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If your alien texts also have a similar structure, then you could use that to identify greetings or other formulaic expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most difficult aspect would be the vocabulary, especially abstract words, or polysemous words (ie words with multiple meanings). For this simple texts, or even encyclopedias and (monolingual) dictionaries would provide a good entrance point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most human languages follow certain quantitative regularities, which we now know about.

Assume English had no reflexives. &amp;quot;I tossed the ball to I&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You tossed the ball to you&amp;quot; (assuming singular &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;) are quite understandable as one person tossing the ball to themselves, thus no reflexive needed. &amp;quot;She tossed the ball to he&amp;quot;, acceptable. But suppose you had &amp;quot;She tossed the ball to she&amp;quot;, and it's been previously established there is more than one woman present. Did person A throw the ball to Person B, or did she toss the ball up in the air and caught it herself? There's no way to tell. An example like that is why German only has a distinctive reflexive in third person; first and second person don't have that same ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get rid of the reflexive entirely if your verb system, to use one possibility, allows a given verb to indicate if it takes a direct or indirect object, or if it does not. Let's say that English verbs used the affix &lt;em&gt;a-&lt;/em&gt; to indicate the verb is ditransitive (it has both a direct and indirect object) and no affix to indicate purely transitive (it only has a direct object).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She a-threw the ball to she.&amp;quot; - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she.&amp;quot; - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under a system like that, English wouldn't need a reflexive pronoun because the verb would make it clear whether the subject was performing the action on themselves, or using themselves as the indirect object, or whether something else was the recipient of the action. One could argue the affix &lt;em&gt;a-&lt;/em&gt; is similar to the single Icelandic reflexive pronoun that's used for everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Inuktitut, verbs that are are equivalent to English intransitive verbs use one suffix attached to them to indicate the subject:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;pisuk &lt;em&gt;to walk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;pisuktunga &lt;em&gt;I am walking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;pisuktutit &lt;em&gt;You (singular) are walking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;pisuktuq &lt;em&gt;He/She/It is walking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specific verbs, equivalent to transitive verbs, use a different set of suffixes that indicate both subject and object:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiq &lt;em&gt;to shoot something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtagit &lt;em&gt;I shoot you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtara &lt;em&gt;I shoot him/her/it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtarma &lt;em&gt;You shoot me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtait &lt;em&gt;You shoot him/her/it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtaanga &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtaatit &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtanga &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot that other he/she/it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's where the reflexives come in: if you don't use the second set of suffixes, but instead use the first set, then the verb becomes a reflexive: the subject did something to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtunga &lt;em&gt;I shoot myself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtutit &lt;em&gt;You shoot yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qukiqtuq &lt;em&gt;He/She/It shoot themself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attaching the suffix that goes on intransitive verbs onto a transitive verb turns that verb into a reflexive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if your verb conjugation allows that sort of thing, then you can get away with not using reflexive pronouns. The verb indicates it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your verb doesn't allow you to do that, then you need reflexives in order to remove the ambiguity when you get into situations where it's not clear who is doing what to whom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way: go back to that first English example I used. Suppose English had multiple third person singular pronouns, such that you didn't just have &amp;quot;she&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;she-1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;she-2&amp;quot;, and perhaps more. Then what does the example look like?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-2.&amp;quot; - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-1.&amp;quot; - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No ambiguity. The context makes it clear that Mary is she-1 (Mary had the ball, she-1 threw the ball, therefore Mary is she-1, so Susan is she-2).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A third option is context. You might have a language where you do need to gather more information in order to determine what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan threw it back.&amp;quot; - Mary obviously threw the ball to Susan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan then asked for the ball.&amp;quot; - Mary apparently didn't throw the ball to Susan, since Susan asked for it after it had been thrown and caught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, three possible ways to get away without reflexive pronouns. So it's not a matter of how common or uncommon it is, but does the grammar of the language allow you to get away without them, or is it necessary because there's no other way of providing the same information?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="301" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:27.510" LastActivityDate="2019-08-26T21:59:09.097" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

About a decade ago, an article in a newspaper talked about the Chinese city of Shenyang but hyphenated it &lt;em&gt;Sheny-ang&lt;/em&gt;. From a German point of view that could have been an acceptable syllable grouping if y is considered a vowel as &lt;em&gt;ya&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;ia&lt;/em&gt;) is not an acceptable diphthong, but &lt;em&gt;Shen-yang&lt;/em&gt; (y as a half-vowel) would also have worked. For Chinese, only &lt;em&gt;Shen-yang&lt;/em&gt; is possible because of the very restricted set of syllables. In Japanese, &lt;em&gt;Shen-yan(g)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;She-nyan(g)&lt;/em&gt; (strictly speaking, Japanese doesn’t have an ng sound unless k or g follow) would be possible with a y in the spelling; &lt;em&gt;She-ni-an(g)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shen-i-an(g)&lt;/em&gt; would strictly require an i in there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you maybe see, what will be seen depends on the language, and only what is possible will be produced. Another example is Japanese again, which only has open syllables or those ending in n. So when a Japanese tries to pronounce &lt;em&gt;startling&lt;/em&gt;, that tends to end up somewhere near &lt;em&gt;sutartolingu&lt;/em&gt;, a five-syllable (seven-mora) word. Thus, a speaker of your conlang will not even consider &lt;em&gt;ep-se&lt;/em&gt; a possibility but will default to &lt;em&gt;e-pse&lt;/em&gt;, if that is all the language does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the record, some languages with loose syllable rules still tend to end up with ambiguity. For example, the Finnish place Yli-Ii will have to have a hyphen to signify the short-long sequence. The German word &lt;em&gt;Bakterien&lt;/em&gt; has an unusual syllable boundary between i and e (&lt;em&gt;Bak-te-ri-en&lt;/em&gt;) while &lt;em&gt;ie&lt;/em&gt; usually just signifies a long /i/ sound. Those things will need to be learnt at school, there is no way to predict.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="116" LastActivityDate="2019-08-24T18:57:06.207" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

At least, find those letters that are used by &quot;only one country&quot;! Such as some letters in Greek alphabets (As far as I know, Greek are the only country that use Greek alphabets).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, I think it's better to divide that alphabets into 2 group. First group are those letters that &quot;every people in every country know how to pronounce&quot;. I think it's good to base it on Japanese, because Japanese has the least amount of pronunciations as far as I know. I believe they are the easiest language to learn pronunciation-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This group of letters build up the &quot;basic and conceptual words&quot;, where all other words are the &quot;combination product&quot; of these words. You can think it as the &quot;building block&quot; of the words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, I think it's better to make the words &quot;a word a syllable&quot; such as Chinese. And 1-syllable words made from the &quot;Basic letters&quot; are the &quot;building block&quot; of the words. More complicated words are the combination of these &quot;basic conceptual words&quot;. Such as &quot;Refrigerator&quot; are actually &quot;Electronic Ice Box&quot; in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also think it's better to make the letters &quot;phonetic&quot;! 'A' is always pronounced 'a' NO MATTER WHAT! Unlike English, 'A' has 2 million ways of pronunciation!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second group of letters are those pronunciations that &quot;All the countries in the world that &lt;strong&gt;COULD EVER MADE&lt;/strong&gt;! I know this might sounds like far fetching, but the idea is &quot;Easy for everybody to learn such language. And for those who are familiar with the language, it will be easy for them to learn &lt;strong&gt;EVERY LANGUAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can think it as &quot;The first group letters are the intersection of the pronunciations of every language, and the second group are the union of the pronunciations of every language&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the second group of letters are only used for those more advanced, probably grammatical, concepts. Which is &quot;Unnecessary for basic conversations but critical for literature&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my question is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are such ideas feasible?

Now, centuries later, Japanese has:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some characters that are identical to (traditional) Chinese ones with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 大 (large) or 中 (centre)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some characters whose written forms have been simplified from traditional Chinese but with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 国 (state) 売 (to sell)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;two sets of characters that are radically simplified/modified from their traditional forms and used only for their phonetic value (katakana and hiragana)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some characters whose written forms are as in traditional Chinese but whose meanings have departed. The best example I could find was 豚 which means &lt;em&gt;pig&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese but &lt;em&gt;piglet&lt;/em&gt; in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Of course, some characters’ meanings departed in Chinese while they are still used in their original sense in Japanese like 湯 (&lt;em&gt;hot water&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese and old Chinese; &lt;em&gt;soup&lt;/em&gt; in modern Chinese; they shouldn’t be listed in a separate bullet point because they generally fit the first)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compound words composed of more than one character with a meaning akin to the Chinese one&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compound words composed of more than one character with a completely different meaning (手紙 which in Japanese means &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt; (the one you send) but in Chinese is toilet paper)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;entirely newly created written compounds, often spelt with hiragana and kanji to better reproduce Japanese grammar&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;new characters created by combining individual parts, e.g. 働 (to work) made from the individual symbols 人 (man, person) and 動 (to move); the former regularly becomes a ‘pole with a steep hat’ in compounds such as 休&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Japanese and Chinese are linguistically so different (Chinese can have closed syllables, it has tones, the vowel registers differ and more), the Japanese pronunciation of Chinese characters obviously differs substantially from their original at the time of borrowing. In general, most characters can be pronounced in two or more ways depending on their surrounding. These pronunciations are grouped into &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt; (have nothing to do with the Chinese original pronunciation; this is a Japanese word with a similar or identical meaning) and &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; (more or less loosely modelled on the Chinese pronunciation when the character was borrowed which may have happened more than once). However, even &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; pronunciations can be considered a simplification at best; a bastardisation of th original pronunciation may be more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Differences notwithstanding, I know one Chinese who claims to be able to get the basic gist of written Japanese and with some crude knowledge of Japanese I was able to grasp the meanings of some things written in Chinese on Taiwan recently.

OK, so first of all, &quot;word&quot; is not the proper term for what I'm trying to say, but I don't know of a term that fits. So. When I say three words, I mean three combinations of consonants and vowels that morphemes can be derived from. From now on, though, I'm going to refer to them as &quot;words&quot;, just because it's the only term that vaguely fits. Again, don't dismiss me immediately. Let me explain my idea, and then please critique it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The three base words would each have particular consonants and one particular vowel, in the structure 1v2v3 (where v represents the vowel, and the numbers represent the three consonants). For a silly example, let's say the three words are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sazar&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire (s, z, r; a)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitiv&lt;/strong&gt;: Lie (k, t, v: i)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lomon&lt;/strong&gt;: Truth (l, m, n; o)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(If I were to actually construct this language, I would &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; use different base words, but let's stick with these for the sake of example.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are thirteen distinct combinations of these letters to be derived from these words (1, 2, 3, v, 1v, 2v, v2, v3, 1v2, 2v3, v2v, 1v2v, v2v3), and that's without rearranging the letters at all. If you allow for rearranging letters, there are thirty-one  distinct combinations (if I did my math right). Including the original &quot;word&quot;, it's thirty-two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these combinations templates can result in 96 different roots/suffixes/prefixes/morphemes/etc. If you somehow made each combination represent some kind of modifier that can be made to a root word, could you construct, if not a language, then at least a grammar system, this way?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, if we made v3 represent plurality (-iv=singular, -on=plural, -ar=dual) and v2 represent person (-it=first person, -om=third person, and -az=second person) then that could be the conjugation for the language, giving you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;: -itiv&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: -aziv&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He/She/It&lt;/strong&gt;: -omiv&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&lt;/strong&gt;: -iton (or -itar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You pl.&lt;/strong&gt;: -azon (or -azar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&lt;/strong&gt;: -omon (or -omar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, -omiv could be extended using v1, which would represent gender (-as=neuter, -ik=female, -ol=male). Using this, the conjugation for he would be the way-too-long-for-conjugation &quot;-omivol&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could make a modifier for roots that determine whether it's a noun, verb, or adjective, and you could also have the three tenses (it's fascinating how much language fits into groups of three) and make cases using combinations of the vowels and consonants, and you would have to stretch some things for prepositions, but maybe instead of having prepositions be words, you could make this an entirely written language and use visuals to convey prepositions (essentially making sentence order influence the physical positions of the objects the words refer to, instead of the grammatical meaning of the words).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would probably need to create a couple (or many) other roots that the modifiers would be added to (or at least start with more flexible words than fire, lie, and truth), but could I at least base the grammar system off of only the three original words and modifiers derived from those three words?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see any obvious issues with this language, besides long words, but I would appreciate it if more experienced conlangers could critique this. Also, if there are no issues with a conlang with only the grammar based on the three base &quot;words&quot;, what about an entire language, where you could only build basic words by combining roots based on the three base words?

For example, you might have one (or many) declension groups that include words ending in consonant clusters; their feature may be that the ending tacked on always begins with a vowel to ensure a pronounceable syllable. On the other hand, you might decide to group together words ending in Vs, Vz, Vd and Vt (V = vowel sound) and have all their declension patterns be Vt + ending. These strategies reduce the potentially very high number of patterns to a more managable set – and are likely to have happened in natural languages anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to point out that Finnish and German are each rather close to what you have in mind. While native Finnish words can only /t, s, n, r, l/ or a vowel, loan words from other languages do not necessarily abide by this rule and newer loans have resisted change to fit Finnish phonotactics somewhat. In declensed forms, an /i/ is added between stem and ending to turn it into a fully allowed syllable. In German (subject to terminal devoicing) there aren’t any restrictions on final sounds that I am aware of. Indeed, declension is usually very simple being made up only of a sometimes optional filler-e plus a case-marking consonant so declension is not as complex as found in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="116" LastActivityDate="2019-12-10T05:20:04.887" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I think what you are suggesting is totally possible and plausible.  The confusion of answers arises from that fact that a &quot;word&quot; can be defined in a couple different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reputable definition which allows for your proposed linguistic system is found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/word_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Collins Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A word is a single unit of language that can be represented in writing or speech. In English, a word has a space on either side of it when it is written.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By that definition, you have designed three possible &quot;units&quot; which can be assigned the title &quot;words&quot; legitimately, and your language system works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you have other possible definitions, such as that found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/word&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Meriam Webster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A speech sound or series of speech sounds that symbolizes and communicates a meaning usually without being divisible into smaller units capable of independent use&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you opt for that definition (which some people do by default), it's a bit harder to stretch &quot;word&quot; to define what you're talking about.  One of your proposed &quot;words&quot; communicates no inherent meaning, and &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; necessarily divisible into smaller units.  Of course, it's a bit ambiguous, and one could argue that this definition of &quot;word&quot; obfuscates the nature of compound nouns etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, I would answer, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;It depends.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;  If you define a word simply as a unit of speech separated by spaces, you're all set.  Other linguists might argue however that you ought to define the different &quot;words&quot; as different &lt;em&gt;classes&lt;/em&gt; of words, with the organization of the letters defining words.  And since you're inventing the language, I guess you can set the rules. ☺&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19" LastActivityDate="2020-01-01T15:59:55.980" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Let me expand a bit below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question in brief&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;, your language does not need a Dative, but &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, your language needs a device (or &amp;quot;construction&amp;quot; in Construction Grammar terms) to express the third argument (also called the &amp;quot;indirect object&amp;quot;) of verbs that take on three arguments (subject, object, indirect object).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, whether you have separate devices (constructions, or in your case &amp;quot;cases&amp;quot;, no pun intended) for semantically different indirect objects or not, that is up to you. Since you already have a Benefactive case that could express an indirect object (whether that is semantically a recipient or a beneficiary or else), then you can use that to express an indirect object that is a simple recipient. So, note that &lt;strong&gt;there can be a mismatch between syntactic arguments and semantic arguments&lt;/strong&gt; (for example indirect object vs. recipient, benefactor, etc). Moreover, depending on what linguistic framework you assume, things can be slightly different. Here I am adhering to some form of (Radical) Construction Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, since you have a Benefactive case and a Lative case you could use the former in sentences like &amp;quot;I gave the book &lt;em&gt;to the man&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I opened the door &lt;em&gt;for the woman&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; and the Lative case for &amp;quot;I went &lt;em&gt;to the market&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I am throwing a stone &lt;em&gt;at you&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.

Suffixes come into play. The hard thing is to know whether the root&#xA;refers to a noun/adjective/verb. And for a verb whether it is transitive or intransitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weird&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Esperanto is that the root itself is not used; say as noun/adjective/verb.

Both Mayan glyphs and Jonathan Gabel's Mayan-inspired Sitelen Sitelen script for writing Toki Pona use enclosure to some degree, though not to the same extent as my example, which produced interesting but unwieldy heavily concentric text objects. (I started to think about making 3D realisations where the text would be read by cutting through the object and reading it in various ways sort of like tree lines.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I started work on a hub-and-spoke type script with no attached spoken language, where sentences are conceived of as wheels with different areas of the wheel being reserved for different syntactic roles, using a small glyph set of symbols whose meaning alters depending on its position in the wheel. These spokes can have spokes of their own. These sentence wheels can be combined around a central hub to create multi-sentence texts: the central hub contains emotional information about the writer's attitude towards the meaning of the text, and organisational information to help the reader decode the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also designed a phonetic abugida (originally for Pandunia, not that it needs or wants it!) arranged something like hangeul, with the oddity that words with more than three syllables are written with double glyphs which combine left- and right-facing halves: the left-most syllable cluster marks its vowels to the left, and the right-most syllable cluster marks its vowels to the right. The overall arrangement of each glyph is also bottom to top (I was sick of scripts assuming that you must always start at the top for everything...) See this bizarrely coloured example made in Pics Art of the Pandunia word 'musikosake', music bag, written first without vowels, and secondly with. The left-most half encodes 'musiko', the right-most 'sake'; m is at the bottom left, above it s, above it k; s appears again on the right, then k above it. Aesthetically the vowels are meant to look like bubbles floating upwards, and the letter shapes are designed so as not to impede the flow of the eye even though information is encoded on both sides of the main glyph. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/uj85U.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/uj85U.png&quot; alt=&quot;pandunia du musikosake&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gave rise to the idea that words in a sentence should be arranged similarly, in balanced pairs or pyramidal shapes starting from the centre of the base. One could write on a square page by turning it lozenge-way, beginning above the middle corner-to corner line, writing from the middle first one way then the other, then going above, creating a pyramid fitting into the paper shape; then repeating under the line by turning the page upside down. Or by writing in upwards columns up to four glyphs wide, where the central or centre-left glyph is the first, aiming to keep syntactic groups such as phrases within one row of, at a maximum, 24 syllables. This would produce columns of glyphs read as 1, 12, 213, and 2134 depending on their weight. Whichever macroarrangement one might choose, overall its arrangement as a script is centrally focused in various ways, inspired by the central focus of each glyph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would say this has some precedent in various South Asian scripts such as Thai in which, whilst there is a firm left-right directionality in the flow of the syllabic characters, within each character there is a much more chaotic flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rikchik's fascinating writing system is also arguably graphically 'middle-leading': &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/rikchik.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/rikchik.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to whether any natural scripts do what you're asking about to any significant extent, other than the example about re Egyptian hieroglyphs and the minor concentric features of Mayan about which I am no expert, I am not aware of any examples - which doesn't at all mean they don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1498" LastEditorUserId="1498" LastEditDate="2020-01-22T20:44:33.927" LastActivityDate="2020-01-22T20:44:33.927" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

There was definitely a large influx from Ido to Occidental, and Occidental as far as I can tell was the most active auxiliary language after Esperanto by the late 30s and into the 1940s. Matejka and Berger had a lot of back-and-forth in the 1920s to early 1930s until Matejka decided to move over to Occidental, which he stayed with until his death in the late 1990s. He's probably the most prominent example of a major Idist who went full in on Occidental. But Berger hadn't taken into account the other source for new Idists, namely new users who weren't satisfied with Esperanto but still liked the overall concept (i.e. the people that thought that Zamenhof &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; got it right).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I removed that sentence from Wikipedia last year when going through the Cosmoglotta archives because it certainly isn't backed up by anything besides Berger's wishes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1514" LastActivityDate="2020-02-03T08:37:29.837" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Stress isn't normally marked even in vowelized Hebrew (apart from liturgy or texts for learners), and it's entirely unnecessary in Toki Pona, since there is no phonemic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this is that it follows ordinary conventions and is most easily intelligible to someone reading in Hebrew. The disadvantage is that implementing this kind of orthography is far from algorithmic and includes unnecessary information in the spelling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Style 2 - minimalistic Hebrew orthography&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since Toki Pona is a minimalistic language, I think that a different transliteration convention would better suit it, to avoid redundancy in writing it. There is precedent for a more minimalistic transcription in the convention used for transliterating, e.g., Akkadian into Hebrew. Modifying it to suit Toki Pona's vowels, we get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a אָ  &#xA;e אֵ  &#xA;i אִ  &#xA;o אֹ  &#xA;u אֻ&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Style 3 - Yiddish orthography&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A third option, if you want to minimize use of diacritics, is to follow Yiddish spelling conventions. The only required diacritic is to distinguish between the two forms of א. The Yiddish convention of using וו instead of ו as a consonant can be safely ignored in Toki Pona. And actually, since there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tokipona.net/tp/MinimalPairs.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;no o/u minimal pairs in Toki Pona&lt;/a&gt;, you could get rid of all diacritics if you instead choose to use ו for both vowels, at the price of losing some information (style 4).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a אַ or א&#xA;e ע or ע&#xA;i אי&#xA;o אָ or ו&#xA;u ו&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Sample differences&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Roman x Hebrew x Minimal x Yiddish x 4-vowel&#xA;a     x אָ      x אָ       x אַ       x א&#xA;akesi x אָקֵסִי   x אָקֵסִ    x אַקעסי   x אקעסי&#xA;anpa  x אָנְפָה   x אָנפָ    x אַנפאַ    x אנפא&#xA;mije  x מִייֵה   x ֵמִי     x מייע    x מייע&#xA;mute  x מוּטֵה   x ֵמֻט     x מוטע    x מוטע&#xA;seli  x סֵלִי    x ִסֵל     x סעלי    x סעלי&#xA;toki  x טוֹקִי   x טֹקִ     x טאָקי    x טוקי&#xA;wawa  x וָאוָה   x וָוָ     x ואַואַ    x ואוא&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58" LastActivityDate="2020-02-05T00:39:04.207" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The notation used in mathematics certainly also does not have the same descriptive power, but it may be useful to look at representations of human language using formal logic, as that's probably the closest tie between linguistics and mathematics that you've got.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Formal semantics, as a discipline, does a lot of work defining a languages grammar using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;typed lambda calculus&lt;/a&gt; (something many computer scientists and mathematicians may have encountered before). This generally follows in the tradition of logician Richard Montague, creating what is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_grammar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Montague grammar&lt;/a&gt;. In a grammar such as this, a sentence like &quot;Every woman sees a man&quot; is represented as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;∀x(woman′(x) → (∃y(man′(y) ∧ sees′(x,y)))&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, in order to derive this compositionally (i.e., from the meaning of each word in the sentence combined together), the meanings of each word is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;woman&quot; = λx.woman′(x)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;man&quot; = λx.man′(x)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;sees&quot; = λy.λx.sees′(x,y)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;a&quot; = λP.λQ.∃x((P(x)∧Q(x)))&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;every&quot; = λP.λQ.∀x((P(x)∧Q(x)))&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you can already see a problem here -- where do we actually get the meanings of woman′ and man′ and sees′ from? In this type of grammar, any noun like &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;man&quot; is a function mapping entities to boolean values -- in other words, &quot;woman&quot; is a list of every entity that exists in the world and either a 1 or a 0 depending whether that entity is a woman. A transitive verb like &quot;sees&quot; is a function that maps entities to entities to boolean values based on whether the first entity sees the second entity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, as you can imagine, isn't a super satisfying way to define a word -- defining &quot;woman&quot; as the set of all women is kinda circular, at best -- but semanticists generally acknowledge that the meaning of individual lexical items just cannot be formalized like this and leave that for lexical semanticists to figure out (and they, to my knowledge, generally do not try to formalize the meanings of individual words like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this has all been sort of a tangent from your original question, but in short: mathematics and the notation we use for it are not language in and of themselves, but there are formal/mathematical ways of representing human language. These formalisms can capture a lot about the relationships between words in a language, but they struggle to capture the actual meaning of a particular word, and thus in that way still ultimately fall short of the underlying expressive power of human language unless augmented with some way of truly capturing a content word's meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most conlangs aim to emulate the expressive capabilities of human language and, as such, we generally would not consider formal languages like programming languages or lambda calculus conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="52" LastActivityDate="2020-02-21T16:49:34.467" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This exercise will also teach you how well (or how poorly) you understand either that kind of writing system or your own language's make-up! If you think a fixed syllable structure might benefit from a syllabary, then try it out! But if you discover that your &amp;quot;fixed syllable structure&amp;quot; is full of complications, exceptions, alterations, and so forth, you might find that a syllabary becomes unwieldy. That's not necessarily a bad thing --- scribes and writers have long had to deal with terribly complex writing systems (Egyptian! Sumerian! Chinese!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating a few &amp;quot;temporary&amp;quot; writing systems for use with any later invented language project could also be useful. Doing this, you won't have to invent a whole new syllabary, a whole new alphabet for each future language project. The actual symbols won't necessarily be the symbols that get used for any language; they're just a tool to help you evaluate compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for an evaluation tool, first I'd do some research into how many symbols various natural language systems have. In English, which uses an alphabet, we basically have 26 symbols. Abjads only notate consonants. So if English used an abjad, that would be 19 to 21 symbols (depending on how you count w &amp;amp; y). At the other end is Chinese, whose logogrammes number over a hundred thousand (according to WP's citation of a modern Chinese dictionary); but you'd only need about 2000 to read a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will you give a rough idea of how much work is going to go into devising characters for the invented language vs how much work is going to go into inventing the language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you'll want to consider how different writing systems work vs how your language works. No writing system perfectly captures the sounds of any language, except for the IPA. Everything else is a compromise. A language that is heavy on nuanced content words, a logography might be too unwieldy. A language with few lexical items might be very comfortable with logogrammes. A language with lots of vowels may not get along with anything but an alphabet: is PN abjad spelling for pan, pawn, pain, pean, pen, pin, pine, pane, pone, pon, or pun?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll also want to consider aesthetic qualities of the writing system. If you find cuneiform logogrammes are just the bees knees, then aesthesis might outweigh the difficulties of having to make hundreds of symbols. If calligraphy is more your style, then an alphabet or an abjad might be better choices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don't neglect combination systems! If you really like the aesthetics of logograpmmes, but don't want to bother with hundreds or thousands, consider a hybrid system where certain symbols have come to take on syllabic or alphabetic function, while certain words or classes of words continue to be written using full logogrammes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:27.510" LastActivityDate="2020-04-23T11:34:53.240" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Alphabets are a pretty reasonable writing system for most spoken languages. I think there's a good reason why the majority of languages with standard written forms use some sort of alphabet. That said, they seem to take a long time to develop, so alphabets are unlikely for concultures that recently discovered writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Abjads&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples: Arabic, Hebrew, Tifinagh. Abjads are good for languages with few vowels and very few minimal pairs distinguished by vowels. It's especially good in languages with triconsonental roots or other forms that undergo dramatic vowel shift as part of regular grammatical processes to improve coherence across grammatical forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Abugidas&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples: Devanagari, Ge'ez (Ethiopic), Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics. Abugdias are pretty good for languages with relatively simple syllable structure (ideally not more complex than (C)CV(C)). Based on the real world, it seems that they're best suited for languages with a high number of tones or phonations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Syllabaries&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples: Hiragana*, Vai, Cherokee. Syllabaries are really only appropriate in languages with relatively simple phonology, ideally not more than (C)V (or adopt a pseudo-syllabary like the kana with separate symbols for coda consonants). Otherwise the number of characters grows exponentially, or will not do a very good job representing all segments of the language, though this is not necessarily a dealbreaker (cf. Cherokee).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;* Hiragana is not a true Syllabary because each kana actually represents a mora, not a syllable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Logographies&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples: Chinese, Cuneiform, Mayan.

So, if a conlang you are going to create is like English, it might need more words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, where and how this conlang is going to be used plays an major role too.

This language does not need words related to technology and science as this language is not going to be used in modern timeline, but an ancient timeline. So if the conlang is going to be made for a specific purpose, it is not necessary to add unrelated words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, number of words could be even 340 words(&lt;em&gt;Taki Taki (also called Sranan), 340 words.

Chinese is a highly analytic language and it uses ideograms. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it has to be noted that writing systems also depend on the languages and cultures that are nearby, but languages like Japanese still created its own script (Hiragana and Katakana, which are syllabaries) so that it would be easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the question, choosing the right writing system is necessary as it is the first thing people are going to study in a language. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you choose ideogram like Chinese, it would be easy if the conlang&#xA;is analytical.

So, I give you the book might be something like&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;book.sg  give.1sg-subj.2sg-obj&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example, book bears no case marking but is clearly the theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The case marking strategy is covered in your example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For word order, we can take an example from English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I give you the book&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;you&lt;/code&gt; is the recipient, but occupies the position directly after the verb. In English you have a choice between using a preposition like &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; instead.

For&#xA;  any given lexical category that can potentially agree, typically only&#xA;  a minority of lexical items in that category actually do.

So the set of words described by &lt;em&gt;jan&lt;/em&gt; would be {&quot;person&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;hunter&quot;, ...}. There are subsets which are more specific, so &lt;em&gt;jan utala&lt;/em&gt; is {&quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;soldier&quot;, &quot;mercenary&quot;, ...}. &lt;em&gt;jan utala pi ma&lt;/em&gt; would be {&quot;soldier&quot;, &quot;private&quot;, &quot;general&quot;, ...}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can envisage it as a tree structure, where the leaves are the word meanings, and the roots (as there would be multiple trees: one for each 'top' primitive) encompasses all of them. As you wander down the tree, the path is an ever longer chain of toki pona words, and the set of meanings covered by those words becomes smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example would be &lt;em&gt;ilo&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;tool&quot;. &lt;em&gt;ilo toki&lt;/em&gt; is a tool for communication: {&quot;telephone&quot;, &quot;telegraph&quot;, &quot;vhf radio&quot;, &quot;loud hailer&quot;, ...}; &lt;em&gt;ilo toki uta suli&lt;/em&gt; (tool talk mouth big) could be a loud hailer.

PIE is just a language like any other before or since. If we review the relevant article, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Font of All Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; explains that &lt;em&gt;morphology is the study of words, how they are formed, and their relationship to other words in the same language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether your language has affixes, adpositions, or some other means of distinguishing roles all of that falls under morphology. Thus, I'd argue that it is &quot;naturalistic&quot; to insert morphology into your protolanguage. After all, it's already there! Else, your daughter languages most likely wouldn't have the concept at all. (And that kind of speculative invented language would be very interesting indeed!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standard examples, consider Latin &amp;amp; English:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;john bit the dog&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the dog bit john&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the dog bit john&lt;br&gt;&#xA;john bit the dog&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;johannem momordit canis&lt;br&gt;&#xA;canem momordit johannes&lt;br&gt;&#xA;canis momordit johannem&lt;br&gt;&#xA;johannes momordit canem&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Morphology tells us how the words are related to each other. Just because English got rid of almost all of its endings doesn't mean we did away with morphology! We just tucked it away somewhere else, in this case, word order. This is why Latin can put the agent or the patient before the verb, but English, except in unusual circumstances, can not. We expect that whatever noun comes before the verb is the agent, be it the dog or be it John. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Morphology has even been proposed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostratic_languages#Morphology&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nostratic&lt;/a&gt;, the protolanguage from which PIE descended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastActivityDate="2020-05-18T18:02:04.607" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

They, too, had ancestors and were influenced by neighbouring languages that didn’t leave any other trace. Humans probably had been speaking for (at least) hundreds of thousands of years at the time of PIE (possibly somewhere between 4500 BCE and 2500 BCE) or PAA (possibly somewhere between 16000 BCE and 10000 BCE) and there are proposed larger families and attempts at reconstructing proto-languages that would group language families like Indo-European and Afroasiatic together (e.g. Nostratic), though they are controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless time-travel gets invented, we will never know how exactly the first language(s) came to be and what they were like, if they were immediately fully-formed or if they lacked features we now consider universal (possibly subordinate clauses?).

Those who are born with this mutation have striking red plumage, yellow/golden beak and eyes, along with an unusual pointy crest, similar to that of a cockatiel. Rékile is often translated to phoenix in Common (British English).

For one thing, the &lt;em&gt;ekzerzaro&lt;/em&gt; does not aim to have a very complete vocabulary because it is assumed that you will check the dictionary for other words you used. That means that the exercises do not teach you the word for &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; even though they teach the word for lion very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some sections are paragraphs to read. My favorite thing about this exercise book is that it contains a short story about a fairy interspersed throughout it. Section 27 is a discussion of Esperanto grammar written in Esperanto, which will probably have to be completely rewritten for your language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll have to make adaptations depending on your language and culture. If you use these exercises to teach contemporary American English, you'll have to adapt to the ways the world has changed in the last century.

For example, a simple change to that Awkwords script will generate plausible dictionary-forms of Nahuatl nouns with 3-syllable bases and &amp;lt;-tl&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;-tli&amp;gt; suffixes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#awkwords version 1.2&#xA;V:ii/i/ee/e/uu/u/aa/a&#xA;C:m/n/p/t/k/kw/h/ts/tl/tc/s/l/c/j/w&#xA;r:(C)V(C)CV(C)CV[tl/CVtli]&#xA;n:100&#xA;nle&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not too hard to look up lists of other morphemes and add their patterns into your word generator. If you want to get really fancy, you can try to find a pre-made computational morphological model for the source language (e.g., a PC-KIMMO or KLEENE or HFST file) and then generate random underlying forms to run through it, but that probably does start to get into the realm of &amp;quot;an insane amount of linguistics&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of decent middle ground, rather than copying the source language morphology. One is to generate a bunch of short, one-or-two-syllable con-morphemes of your own that match the source phonology, and then use those as the base units from which you generate conlang words, rather than going directly from the phonology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another is to try to imitate the source language phonemic distribution. For that, you basically just need a big list of source language words, from which you can extract statistical information. The simplest way to do that is to just count up occurrences of each phoneme, but if you know a little bit more statistics, or are willing to learn, you can construct a conditional distribution model for which phonemes occur most often in different particular positions, and then generate random words based on those specialized distributions, rather than the default uniform distribution. Awkwords can't handle that kind of model sophistication, but other word generators, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/conlang-software-dev/Logopoeist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Logopoeist&lt;/a&gt;, can, and it's also not too hard to write up a custom generator just for your particular naming language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastActivityDate="2020-06-27T00:16:38.467" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This alone makes it evident why the standard markers a noun may present will usually be absent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.com/stable/413800&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Marianne Mithun describes&lt;/a&gt; four major reasons to incorporate a noun (quoting summary from Rosenfelder, &lt;em&gt;Advanced Language Construction&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 182-184):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narrow the focus of a verb by adding some sort of descriptor to it. You may want to incorporate tools, for example. In Nahuatl, such incorporation often translate to &amp;quot;X like (a) Y(s)&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow an otherwise oblique argument (usually of a semantically, if not syntactically &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labile_verb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;labile verb&lt;/a&gt;) to become its subject (cf. English, &amp;quot;My head aches&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;I have a headache&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background an argument that has already been mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a classifier of some sort. This is an integral part of verbal morphology in the Algonquian Languages, for example. Chinese also does it to create suppletive forms of single-syllable verbs that may be highly polysemous or homophonous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add to this the fact that in most languages, you cannot incorporate the subject noun of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unergative_verb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;unergative verb&lt;/a&gt; (probably no language at all allow it, but I haven't looked into it in details), it is easy to see why incorporated/nonfinite nouns have little need for all the bells and whistles of regular arguments: you are either generalizing or backgrounding the noun, so you don't want or need to add these syntactic elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding possessive markers specifically, I should point out that even in languages without incorporation, possessive markers are liable to be dropped if the possessor is already a separate argument in the sentence: &lt;em&gt;I stole &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt; from him, It struck him on &lt;strong&gt;the nose&lt;/strong&gt;, J'ai mal à &lt;strong&gt;la tête&lt;/strong&gt;, Je lui ai cassé &lt;strong&gt;le bras&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if a language has incorporation, it is usually &lt;em&gt;rare for it to have a fully separate word category of adjectives&lt;/em&gt; as we understand them to begin with! In many of these languages, adjectives take the form of descriptive verbs or adjunct nouns that can themselves be incorporated into themain noun (cf. English Bluebeard, whiteboard, blackbird...), and syntactically, it doesn't typically work to incorporate an entire relative sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, some languages, such as Chukchi &lt;em&gt;do allow for the whole noun+adjective&lt;/em&gt; phrase to be incorporated, and quite a few languages &lt;em&gt;allow for numeral markers to be incorporated&lt;/em&gt;, although this is actually part of the verbal paradigm itself i.e. if you incorporate &amp;quot;I saw two persons&amp;quot; you are incorporating the noun &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; to a verb root that means &amp;quot;see two X&amp;quot;, not incorporating &amp;quot;two men&amp;quot;. That's what happens in Southern Tiwa or Algonquian languages (Nishnaabemwin: &lt;em&gt;Giibimdaaswishiniizhdaabaan’gizwag&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;They came in twelve carloads&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, I would say aside from adjuncts noun and adjectives (which itself would make your language unusual, though not outside the realm of human experience), any other grammatical attribute of the noun you want to &amp;quot;incorporate&amp;quot; you should do so as an integral part of you verb paradigm, not as part of the incorporated root &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.

Acoustically, vowels (and most sounds, actually) are simply combinations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;formants&lt;/a&gt;: specific frequencies at which the vocal tract resonates. The differences between vowels are then caused by differences in the frequencies of the formants. This can be easily seen on a &lt;em&gt;spectrogram&lt;/em&gt;, like this one from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Spectrogram_-iua-.png&quot; alt=&quot;formant image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this spectrogram, the vowel [i] has its first two formants at roughly 500 and 2500 Hz, while [u] has its first two formants at roughly 500 and 1000 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, it turns out that biphonic singing works on exactly the same principle! Biphonic singing works through shaping the mouth so that one of the formants becomes loud enough to be perceived as a separate note. Note that this uses exactly the same mechanism used in vocalising vowels; the only difference is that the shape of the mouth is changed slightly to emphasise the formants. To experience this yourself, you can try saying [u͡ʉ͡y͡ʉ͡u] very slowly; if you listen carefully to what you are saying, you should be able to hear a note growing higher and then lower in pitch. This note is one of the formants of the vowels (the first formant, I think); Biphonic singers simply emphasise this formant so it becomes loud enough to easily hear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to summarise, languages already use vowels which could be described as ‘biphonic’ — the only reason we don’t hear it that way is because the formants aren’t as strong as they are in biphonic singing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(For more information, you may find &lt;a href=&quot;https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/voice.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/voice.html&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/xoomi.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/xoomi.html&lt;/a&gt; interesting.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2729" LastActivityDate="2020-07-22T09:44:17.183" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you have a &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; with just one bit of information, you can express two meanings, which are &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;off&amp;quot;. If you want to express more complex ideas, you need a longer message. For example, if you want to express the decimal numbers from 0 to 15 in binary, you need at least four bits to represent them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We as people have created a system where we know beforehand what the bits mean when we send and receive them. So if we send a message consisting of four binary digits, e.g. &amp;quot;0010&amp;quot;, then we know that that means the number &amp;quot;2&amp;quot;, because that's the convention we've agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you could certainly expand this principle by using three signs instead of two, and use conventions and codes to create meanings. The snag is that the complexity of the message would increase massively. For example, if I want to write the word &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; in English, I only need a total of seven symbols, and each symbol can be one of 26 signs (the English alphabet.) If I want to write the word &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; in binary, however, it will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;0110110101100101011100110111001101110011011000010110011101100101&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is a considerably longer message, because I only have two signs to work with, not 26.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other disadvantage is: you need a convention or a &amp;quot;code&amp;quot; which both the sender of the message (the speaker) and the receiver (the listener) to be understood before a message can be transmitted. If you saw the above binary sequence out of context, you would have no way of knowing it meant &amp;quot;message&amp;quot;, because I haven't told you that it represents a sequence of ASCII characters. It could just be meaningless computer code, or a very large number, or part of a recipe for a salmon bake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you could theoretically create a language with three &amp;quot;signs&amp;quot; and combine them to make meanings. For example, if your words were &amp;quot;ka&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pi&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ol&amp;quot;, then you could have the following sequences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;kapi = woman&#xA;kapiol = man&#xA;olka = cat&#xA;olpipika = dog&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so on. But you would have two problems with such a language:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complexity of each resulting &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; would vastly increase as you make the message longer, and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no obvious relation between your signs and your word, so you would have to make your messages understood by pre-existing codes, agreed between the speaker and listener.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2758" LastActivityDate="2020-08-09T14:37:50.167" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This makes for efficient communication in perfect conditions, but as soon as there is any noise (in the widest sense of 'noise'), communication could get disrupted. If any symbol is changed during transmission (ie misheard, or dropped), then the meaning of your message will change in a way that cannot be recovered. It would also require perfect production, ie no typos or other mistakes, as they would all change the meaning. Because there is no redundancy, you cannot even recognise a typo, as it would simply be another, different, word. That of course is in the extreme case only. Imagine you numbered all the words in your dictionary and would simply transmit a sequence of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of information density is not in the language but the texts created in the language. Any text requires shared context between author and recipient for the receiver to be able to interpret the message. Anything not shared between the sender and receiver needs to be contained in the message itself. So even if your language itself is very information dense (or redundant), your messages don't have to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is probably a natural limit for information density in human languages. If every letter you write has an impact on the meaning of your message, you need a huge cognitive effort to create it (either when learning the language, or when writing a text in it). And similarly, the receiver needs to spend a lot of effort into decoding/understanding your message. So while it is space efficient (you get away with shorter messages), the time efficiency is pretty poor. And if your message content gets lost in the process, you need to re-transmit, which adds to that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those reasons languages tend not to be on the extremes of density (or redundancy).

As part of that process, one step was determining how much information was conveyed per syllable. They used Vietnamese as a baseline, arbitrarily giving it a value of 1.00. If a language conveyed the same information in more syllables than Vietnamese, it would be lower than 1 (you need more syllables to communicate the same information). English was 0.91. Japanese was 0.49. In other words, you needed nearly twice as many syllables to communicate the same thing in Japanese as you did in English, Mandarin (0.94), or obviously Vietnamese (1.00).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you compare speaking rates (how fast those syllables are spoken), it turns out that most languages are about the same when it comes to transmitting information per time, between 0.9 and 1.1 (Vietnamese again being 1.00). Except Japanese, which although having easily the fastest speaking rate of the languages tested, because of the extremely low density of information per syllable, they had the lowest rate of transmission by far, at 0.74.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Japanese is significantly &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; information dense than many other widely spoken languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You see the same thing in other agglutinative languages.

So here is a more &amp;quot;common language&amp;quot; example from the Government of Nunavut's website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://livehealthy.gov.nu.ca/en/health-topics/injuries/preparing-hunt-land&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://livehealthy.gov.nu.ca/en/health-topics/injuries/preparing-hunt-land&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Telling someone at home where you are going. Even if you are going&#xA;out on the land for just a few hours, you should tell at least one&#xA;person at home the names of all riders and passengers, where you are&#xA;going, and when you plan to come back. If you do not return in time,&#xA;this person will be able to send for help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here is the Innuinaqtun version:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Uqaqlugu kimut humungauliqtutin. Aulaaqhimanahuaqtillutin ikituni&#xA;ikaangnini, uqaqtukhauyutin atauhinaugumi inuk aimavingni kitkut&#xA;aulaaqatiniatatin, humungauliktutin, humi utiqnahuaqtuninlu.&#xA;Uttinngitkuvin mikhaatigun, tamna inuk ikayutikhangnik&#xA;aullaqtittniaqtuq.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Innuinaqtun is 21 words compared to the English 67. If, however, you look at the &lt;em&gt;syllables&lt;/em&gt;, there's 109 compared to English's 73. English clearly has the higher information density per syllable. Just because the average word is longer doesn't make the language more information dense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue with Inuktitut, just as with Japanese, is that the number of possible different syllables is limited due to the phonotactics of the language, which means you have to use more syllables to compensate for the limited inventory you have. Standard Inuktitut has at most 210 possible syllables. Japanese has, depending on who you ask, about 400 possible syllables, so you could have that number of possible one-syllable words. With English phototactics, for &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; English, you have about &lt;em&gt;316,800&lt;/em&gt; possible one-syllable words (there is about 9,300 in use).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this difference is the number of consonant clusters allowed and the ridiculous number of vowels in most English dialects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr summary: to have a more information dense and still practical language (so you allow some natural redundancy and not have so many near-homonyms that mininterpretation due to missing something is a constant problem), you need a language with a lot of possible syllables and phonotactics that allow those syllables to be used or combined into sufficiently many distinct morphenes, however you put those morphemes together or not in any kind of language, whether isolating or agglutinative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="301" LastActivityDate="2020-08-13T21:32:20.783" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

And as I said earlier, Urdu does use ہ (based on ه), though I believe ے is more common (except word-intially, where it can't appear).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me like some twist on ي is the most common across languages, but which one to pick is not obvious (though I expect they'd all be about equally clear to someone who isn't already familiar with one of them). ە is more uniform, but might be a bit less common, and in languages that use both (like Uyghur and Kurdish) it seems that the ي variant usually represents /e/, while ە is something like /ɛ/.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I'd probably suggest ێ, but either option seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script#Additional_letters_used_in_other_languages&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Arabic script § Additional letters used in other languages (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt; (and various language and script articles mostly linked to from there)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2831" LastActivityDate="2020-09-28T18:14:47.500" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

But be clear what kind of features you want to be able to express – not every possible distinction needs to be expressed in language. Do you want to mark the gender of the subject in the verb? Perfectly possible, but probably not very useful, unless your language is for a very gender-segregated society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the more features you want to express, the more complex your grammar will be. As an extreme example, toki pona pretty much only uses word order and a few particles to distinguish between subject/verb/object, and ignores number or gender markers.

The first question you should ask yourself is &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Do I want to have an analytic, agglutinative, fusional, or polysynthetic language?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; This will decide whether your language will be making sentences by putting a lot of words together in a specific order (like English or Mandarin), putting a bunch of affixes on a moderate number of words (like Korean or Navajo), putting a few very specific affixes on a moderate number of words (like Spanish or German), or stringing together a large number of component pieces to make a few very specific words (like Coptic or West Greenlandic).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, you should ask &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Should my language be primarily head-initial or head-final?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; A head-initial language will probably have Verb-Subject-Object or Subject-Verb-Object word order, put auxiliary verbs before matrix verbs (e.g. &lt;em&gt;have gone&lt;/em&gt;), use prepositions (e.g. &lt;em&gt;at home&lt;/em&gt;), put adjectives after the nouns they modify (e.g. &lt;em&gt;house new&lt;/em&gt;), and mark the start of a relative clause. A head-final language will probably have Subject-Object-Verb word order, put matrix verbs before auxiliaries (e.g. &lt;em&gt;gone have&lt;/em&gt;), use postpositions (e.g. &lt;em&gt;home at&lt;/em&gt;), put adjectives before the nouns they modify (e.g. &lt;em&gt;new house&lt;/em&gt;), and mark the end of a relative clause. Of course, as these examples show, you don't have to pick one exclusively, but nearly all languages are predominantly one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, you should ask &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Should my language be primarily head-marking or dependent-marking?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; A head-marking language will be more likely to use polypersonal agreement instead of case marking, mark possessa instead of possessors, and have adpositions that agree with their referents. A dependent-marking language will be more likely to have case marking, mark possessors instead of possessa, and have demonstratives and adjectives that agree with their referents. Again, you don't have to go all in here, but you should lean either one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For these last two especially, it's very helpful to learn which word is going to be the head of a given phrase. For example, the head of a sentence is the verb, the head of a noun phrase is the noun, the head of an adpositional phrase is the adposition, the head of a possessive construction is the possessum, etc. These aren't really intuitive (at least to me), so it's best to just memorize them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing these three things right from the start will help you avoid some of the most common typological pitfalls that will make your language feel clunky to use. But choose carefully, because these choices will end up so ingrained in the language that it will be a royal pain to try to change them later. From here, you can move to making more specific decisions, like what grammatical distinctions you actually want to make, and how specifically you're going to make those distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2609" LastActivityDate="2020-10-06T17:48:25.773" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Plugged into my computer at this moment is a 512 GB thumb drive. It is, in its (thick) protective case, 50mm long, 20mm wide, and 10mm thick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a generation ship, made by a technologically advanced culture. Let's assume, for simplicity and practicality's sake, that everyone is fluent in one common language. Just for the hell of it, let's say English. And so, to keep people entertained, not only written material is provided but recordings. Lots and lots of recordings. Music. Movies. Documentaries. Learning material. TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assume they provide the material in 720p resolution, so not quite full HD but better than standard. You'll get about 3.5 hours per gigabyte. Rounding off at 500GB of data, my perfectly ordinary thumb drive has a capacity of roughly 1,750 hours of audiovisual recordings. That's &lt;em&gt;over 10 weeks&lt;/em&gt; of video. That's every Marvel Cinematic Movie released so far repeated 35 times. That's 2,500 &amp;quot;one hour&amp;quot; (ie, 42 minutes) North American television episodes. On a single drive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a box beside my desk that is abut 100x150x300mm in size. I could stick about 450 of my thumb drives in there. That's 225,000GB, or about 787,500 hours of video. That's &lt;em&gt;ninety years&lt;/em&gt; of video. All in something the size of a small box easily picked up by one hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, one thing we could safely assume, if no one is trying to censor the material for some reason, and putting aside the stability of storage media, since if we're talking a long duration ship and everything is still working is probably a mostly solved problem, the people on board may well have access to a ridiculous amount of recording of people talking, and they're going to grow up with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's not going to be any argument over how people talked a 1000 years before. No equivalent discussions over whether someone pronounced &lt;em&gt;vici&lt;/em&gt; as &amp;quot;veechee&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;weechee&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;veekee&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;weekee&amp;quot; because &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they will know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. They'll know about different accents and how people pronounced vowels and consonants and how the written was different from the spoken because they can literally see and hear it first hand. It is what they will learn from because they grew up with it, just as their parents learned it, and their parents, and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone proposing the language will radically change in this scenario, &lt;em&gt;how?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't use a historical example of how much a given language has changed over a few centuries to make your argument because you are ignoring the fact that audiovisual recordings fundamentally alter how people communicate and never existed during the time spans your examples are going to cover.

There are a couple of ways around the problems that were mentioned. The first way is to have a highly inflectional language; this would give an explanation for why words are similar, but the words would get longer. Because you would already be expecting to have longer words, this could at least be turned into a feature rather than a detriment. The second way is to allow for less 'traditional', let's say, syllable structures. Think of the English word 'strengths' (/stɹeŋθs/) which has a CCCVCCC structure. Using a much more restrictive (C)V(N) will only make the generations of new words more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the potential overlap of meaning. The word &lt;em&gt;moku&lt;/em&gt; in toki pona basically means &lt;em&gt;to Ingest&lt;/em&gt; but it also means &lt;em&gt;something that is ingestible&lt;/em&gt; (to Eat, to Drink, Food, Beverage). If you don't mind having words having a number of meanings which are generally related, then this shouldn't be a problem. If you want a free couple of words, don't put 'to Be', 'of/from', or (more extremely) 'to Have' into the language.

You need it to sound familiar but different to native speakers of that language. There isn't a lot of ways to accomplish this, you need to keep your changes small. My advice would be to prepare &amp;quot;find and replace patterns&amp;quot; for the vowels and a few common words, leave most of the consonants as is, and just run them over the text and use that as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eg.

Las distinciones sociales solo pueden fundarse en la utilidad común. La finalidad de toda asociación política es la conservación de los derechos naturales e imprescriptibles del hombre. Esos derechos son la libertad, la propiedad, la seguridad y la resistencia a la opresión. La fuente de toda soberanía reside esencialmente en la nación; ningún individuo, ni ninguna corporación pueden ser revestidos de autoridad alguna que no emane directamente de ella. La libertad consiste en poder hacer todo aquello que no cause perjuicio a los demás. El ejercicio de los derechos naturales de cada hombre, no tiene otros límites que los que garantizan a los demás miembros de la sociedad el disfrute de los mismos derechos. Estos límites solo pueden ser determinados por la ley. La ley solo puede prohibir las acciones que son perjudiciales a la sociedad. Lo que no está prohibido por la ley no puede ser impedido. Nadie puede verse obligado a aquello que la ley no ordena. La ley es expresión de la voluntad de la comunidad. Todos los ciudadanos tienen derecho a colaborar en su formación, sea personalmente, sea por medio de sus representantes. Debe ser igual para todos, sea para proteger o para castigar. Siendo todos los ciudadanos iguales ante ella, todos son igualmente elegibles para todos los honores, colocaciones y empleos, conforme a sus distintas capacidades, sin ninguna otra distinción que la creada por sus virtudes y conocimientos. Ningún hombre puede ser acusado, arrestado y mantenido en confinamiento, excepto en los casos determinados por la ley, y de acuerdo con las formas por esta prescritas. Todo aquel que promueva, solicite, ejecute o haga que sean ejecutadas órdenes arbitrarias, debe ser castigado, y todo ciudadano requerido o aprendido por virtud de la ley debe obedecer inmediatamente, y se hace culpable si ofrece resistencia. La ley no debe imponer otras penas que aquellas que son estrictas y evidentemente necesarias; y nadie puede ser castigado sino en virtud de una ley promulgada con anterioridad a la ofensa y legalmente aplicada. Todo hombre es considerado inocente hasta que ha sido declarado convicto. Si se estima que su arresto es indispensable, cualquier rigor mayor del indispensable para asegurar su persona ha de ser severamente reprimido por la ley. Ningún hombre debe ser molestado por razón de sus opiniones, ni aún por sus ideas religiosas, siempre que al manifestarlas no se causen trastornos del orden público establecido por la ley.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Spelling change) Replace &lt;em&gt;ce&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ci&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;thi&lt;/em&gt; (as they are pronounced): &lt;em&gt;nacen&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;nathen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sociales&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;sothiales&lt;/em&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Spelling change) The acute accent indicates the position of the dynamic stress when it falls in a place other than where it's expected:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the acute is on the last syllable before an &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; or an &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, delete the acute and double the consonant: &lt;em&gt;ningún&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;ningunn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;demás&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;demass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;razón&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;razonn&lt;/em&gt;.

(Romanian did it; we have &lt;em&gt;lup&lt;/em&gt; for Spanish &lt;em&gt;lobo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tot&lt;/em&gt; for Spanish &lt;em&gt;todo&lt;/em&gt; etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the word ends in &lt;em&gt;-wo&lt;/em&gt;, replace with &lt;em&gt;-u&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the word ends in &lt;em&gt;-yo&lt;/em&gt; (at this stage of the modifications), replace the &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;-u&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the final &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt; is the only vowel in the word, replace with &lt;em&gt;-u&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace final &lt;em&gt;-i&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;iy&lt;/em&gt;, final &lt;em&gt;-e&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, and final &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;. (Old French did the last one.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now do the plurals: replace final &lt;em&gt;-os&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;-uy&lt;/em&gt;. (Romanian went even further, but let's keep it Spanish-y.) Replace final &lt;em&gt;-es&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;iy&lt;/em&gt;.

But word order seems so flexible, I don't see what I need to do when creating a conlang in terms of how to structure nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles, to make sure you can understand the sentence. What are the key techniques or procedures to follow in designing this? So you can clearly tell what is a noun, verb, adjective, or particle. How do we even do this in regular natural languages? I don't understand. And I don't know how to search for this in Google to learn more about how we resolve the sentences meaning without having clear and unique patterns that clearly separate nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles from each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of examples on why it's confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see the &lt;strong&gt;big black oak tree&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tree&lt;/code&gt; is the noun, and &lt;code&gt;big black oak&lt;/code&gt; are modifiers on the noun sort of thing. So you could say they are adjectives or &amp;quot;features&amp;quot; of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see &lt;strong&gt;the big&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here &lt;code&gt;big&lt;/code&gt; is the noun, like &lt;code&gt;The Big&lt;/code&gt;, as in something big, in which you are invoking a lot of context in your listeners mind. Or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see &lt;strong&gt;the black&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here black is the noun, like all you see is darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In these sentences, there is no change in the structure of the words, but they take on different roles in the sentences. That is, &lt;code&gt;big&lt;/code&gt; can be an adjective or noun (or even a verb!) without adding a specific prefix or suffix to that base.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't come up with a science on why we are able to properly interpret these sentences. In my conlang, I am thinking that, in order to make it easier to interpret, I would have special endings on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles. So you would have the equivalent of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see-ami the big-azi black-azi oak-azi tree-ali&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this sort of system, every verb would end in &lt;code&gt;-ami&lt;/code&gt;, every adjective with &lt;code&gt;-azi&lt;/code&gt;, and every noun with &lt;code&gt;-ali&lt;/code&gt;. I keep on thinking I &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; such a system in order to make the sentences comprehensible. I would use this structure &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;strong&gt;strict word order&lt;/strong&gt; to make it so sentences are comprehensible. So what I keep thinking I &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;, in summary, is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific endings&lt;/strong&gt; on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles, to distinguish them easily.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strict word order&lt;/strong&gt; in sentences, so you can easily tell what is in the adjective place, in the noun place, in the verb place, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the problem is, &lt;em&gt;this is not how natural languages work&lt;/em&gt;! Even in English which has a somewhat strict word order (even though you can be quite flexible with it if you want), like I demonstrated above, you &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt; have specific endings on words, and you don't have a super strict 100%-of-the-time word order. &lt;em&gt;(English has some word endings like &lt;code&gt;-ing&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-ly&lt;/code&gt; and such, but these are not even consistent 100% of the time)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, I am looking across a few languages, and nouns, verbs, and adjectives in each language might be allowed to &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; with vowels or consonants, and might all have endings which are the same. That is, there isn't even a pattern which clearly separates nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles into separate categories based on the word's morphology! For example, let's use English. You have these words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bully. &lt;em&gt;(Noun, &amp;quot;A mean sort of person&amp;quot;, ends in &lt;code&gt;-ly&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Clearly. &lt;em&gt;(Adjective, ends in &lt;code&gt;-ly&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Sully. &lt;em&gt;(Verb, &amp;quot;to make dirty&amp;quot;, ends in &lt;code&gt;-ly&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some rules are more strict, like I can't seem to find any adjectives that end in &lt;code&gt;-ed&lt;/code&gt;, which is used for past-tense or state sort of verbs, &lt;code&gt;created&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;acted&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;iced&lt;/code&gt;, etc. But this &lt;code&gt;-ly&lt;/code&gt; ending can go on any type of word. Same with other endings, like &lt;code&gt;-ing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bring. &lt;em&gt;(Infinitive verb, ends in &lt;code&gt;-ing&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Clearing. &lt;em&gt;(present participle verb, ends in &lt;code&gt;-ing&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Ring. &lt;em&gt;(Noun, or verb, ends in &lt;code&gt;-ing&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Amusing. &lt;em&gt;(Adjective, ends in &lt;code&gt;-ing&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All kinds of other examples exist (of prefixes and suffixes) where they are used across nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.. In many other languages too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other words, which I'm using in English but might come from other languages, are nouns which have all sorts of endings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Man. &lt;em&gt;(Noun, ends in consonant &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Joy. &lt;em&gt;(Noun, ends in consonant &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Dao. &lt;em&gt;(Noun, &amp;quot;the Way&amp;quot;, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Glee. &lt;em&gt;(Noun, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Rabbi. &lt;em&gt;(Noun, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then same for verbs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assign. &lt;em&gt;(Verb, ends in consonant &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Play. &lt;em&gt;(Verb, ends in consonant &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Echo. &lt;em&gt;(Verb, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Free. &lt;em&gt;(Verb, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Ski. &lt;em&gt;(Verb, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And same for adjectives:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Green. &lt;em&gt;(Adjective, ends in consonant &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Happy. &lt;em&gt;(Adjective, ends in consonant &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Latino. &lt;em&gt;(Adjective, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Eerie. &lt;em&gt;(Adjective, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Pakistani. &lt;em&gt;(Adjective, ends in vowel &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this basically shows, at least for English, there is no relation between the word ending and whether it is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.. &lt;em&gt;So it makes me think in my conlang, I don't need to add the constraint of having nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles have different endings to make them distinguishable&lt;/em&gt;. Somehow we are able to tell the difference in sense of these words based on some other nebulous thing, like context or meaning/semantics during the flow of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question is, how do I use these facts when constructing a conlang? Can I pick any &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; word and attach &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; ending on any part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, particle)? And will the language still work? &lt;em&gt;How can I tell if it will work and not be confusing&lt;/em&gt;? What do I do when developing the conlang to test if it is confusing or not how I have structured words?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without having the conlang &lt;em&gt;completed&lt;/em&gt; and working, (while it is being developed), as I try to generate example sentences, it seems like it would lead to pure confusion not having more rigid patterns in the words to distinguish nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How should I be thinking about this to make some progress? I am stuck on the step of how to create words in different parts of speech, and place them in an order in sentences. I have created a pattern for how word &amp;quot;bases&amp;quot; are defined (i.e. they have to start and end with a consonant), but that is even limiting, I would like it if some can start or end with a vowel too...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How should I conceptualize the differences between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles, so I can generate words that flow together into a sentence but aren't confusing? It seems that adding specific word endings would remove the confusion, but what else will remove the confusion so I don't need to do that, and I can be like English in that words of various parts of speech can have any vowel/consonant start or end the word?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2990" LastEditorUserId="2990" LastEditDate="2020-12-27T19:52:26.203" LastActivityDate="2020-12-29T08:44:32.003" Title="How do you remove the confusion in a conlang when creating and distinguishing nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles?"

What this means is that in general, there is no way to find the part of speech of a word knowing only the word itself. You have to memorise it separately for each word.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good way of seeing this is to observe that two languages may assign different parts of speech to exactly the same word when it is borrowed from one language to another. For instance, &lt;em&gt;boil&lt;/em&gt; is a verb in English. But when it was loaned into the Papuan language Komnzo, it was borrowed as a member of the Komnzo class of ‘property nouns’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/212&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Döhler 2018&lt;/a&gt;). There is nothing inherently ‘nouny’ or ‘verby’ about the form or function of this word; you simply have to memorise that &lt;em&gt;boil&lt;/em&gt; is a verb in English and a property noun in Komnzo. And this can even happen within a language: the English word &lt;em&gt;release&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, is both a noun and a verb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if word classes cannot be reliably distinguished based on their form or their semantics¹, then what is the difference between different parts of speech? The answer is simple: parts of speech specify &lt;em&gt;the environments in which words can be used&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, consider this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw the _____.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sentence has a gap in it. You can make a grammatical sentence by filling this gap with nouns: &lt;em&gt;I saw the &lt;strong&gt;dog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I saw the &lt;strong&gt;cat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I saw the &lt;strong&gt;chair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I saw the &lt;strong&gt;release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I saw the &lt;strong&gt;idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. (Note that, even though the last example doesn’t really make sense, it still counts as it is a grammatical sentence.) On the other hand, if you try this with a non-noun, the result is ungrammatical: *&lt;em&gt;I saw the sit&lt;/em&gt;, *&lt;em&gt;I saw the eat&lt;/em&gt;, *&lt;em&gt;I saw the is&lt;/em&gt;. So we can use this example to give a definition of a noun: a word which makes a grammatical sentence when preceeded by &lt;em&gt;I saw the&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This definition can be made a lot more general though: a noun is simply a word which can follow a determiner. What is a determiner? Well, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; define it as something which can precede a noun, but that would be circular. Instead, simply note that there are a fixed set of 20 or so words which can occur in such a position: &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; and the like. A determiner is then just one of these words. Determiners are thus a ‘closed class’: a part of speech which has a fixed number of words, and into which no more words can be added. Note that each language has a slightly different set of closed classes, though there are similarities: articles, numbers, adpositions and adjectives, for instance, are often closed. (Komnzo unusually has &lt;em&gt;verbs&lt;/em&gt; as a closed class, explaining why my example of &lt;em&gt;boil&lt;/em&gt; above was loaned as a noun rather than a verb.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you can go further. English nouns can be used after a determiner — but there are several other environments in which nouns can occur. They can take the plural marker &lt;em&gt;-s&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;dogs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;cats&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;chairs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;releases&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt;. They can also modify another noun: &lt;em&gt;dog leash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;cat collar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;chair wood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;release method&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;idea food&lt;/em&gt;. (The last few examples are a bit contrived, but illustrate the point well enough). So, you can use this to define nouns in English: English nouns are that word class which can be used after a determiner, take a plural marker, and modify another noun. Or, to put it another way, if you find a word which can occur in all these places — why then, that word must be a noun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question ‘How should I conceptualize the differences between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles?’: conceptualize it in terms of morphosyntactic environments (the fancy name for what I’ve been talking about). A word class is distinguished by the environments it can occur in: if you know what word class a word occurs in, then you know in which environments you can use in, and &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will use one final example to illustrate the point. Consider the well-known example sentence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gostak distims the doshes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this sentence, I can tell that &lt;em&gt;gostak&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dosh&lt;/em&gt; are nouns, while &lt;em&gt;distim&lt;/em&gt; is a verb — even though I may never have seen these words before. Why? Just look at the environments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gostak&lt;/em&gt; occurs in the environment ‘the ____’. Thus we know it is a noun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dosh&lt;/em&gt; occurs in the environment ‘the ____’, and also takes the suffix &lt;em&gt;-s&lt;/em&gt;. Thus it must be a noun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For &lt;em&gt;distim&lt;/em&gt;, we can look at the position of the word in the sentence. It occurs between two noun phrases; this is obviously sufficient to make up a complete sentence. Any word with this property in English must be a verb.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Further reading: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alex.francois.online.fr/data/AlexFrancois_2017_Economy-word-classes_St-in-Lg_print.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;François’s analysis of Hiw word classes&lt;/a&gt; is a particularly illuminating example of these ideas. I highly recommend reading through this paper for a detailed discussion of how word classes can be defined with reference to syntactic environments.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;¹ Well, this is a slight lie. There are clearly semantic distinctions between word classes such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Also, I vaguely remember that there are some languages in which some parts of speech &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have phonological correlates, though I can’t remember their names. My point is that neither of these are particularly reliable ways to determine parts of speech, which should ideally be defined using only morphosyntactic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2729" LastActivityDate="2020-12-29T08:44:32.003" CommentCount="7" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Chinese and Japanese didn't used to have punctuation, nor apparently did Latin and Ancient Greek. So I'd say that's the first thing to consider: your proto-script needn't have had any punctuation at all. But over time, scribes found that it was a pain in the backside to write long continuous strings and just figure out by context where sentences end and begin. How they choose to delimit those sentences* is up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe writers split up sentences using a vertical bar or a slash, or a middle dot like the interpunct used in Japanese and Chinese, or some other kooky character. Maybe sentences are grouped using something similar to brackets at the start and end. Or maybe ancient authors actually drew a circle or line around each sentence to delimit it from the next (it never had to be practical!) Future authors realised that, if all they wanted to do was tell where one sentence ended and another began, all they had to do is draw a circle around every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(So you might have a paragraph like this.) Where every other sentence is uncircled. (And the next sentence is circled again.) Imagine that these brackets are circles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Punctuation within sentences is, again, up to you. It's perfectly possible that your script's writers never decided that they needed to split up clauses using commas, separate lists using colons, or mark speech using quotation marks etc. Maybe they mark speech separately with an underline, or a dotted line. Or maybe they write using different coloured inks depending on type of sentence being written.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe, instead of little marks, your proto-script could have fully-fledged characters without any spoken value, but which are used to delimit clauses in the same way as commas are. Of course, over time these might have reduced and transformed into a small, easy to write character - in much the same way that Simplified Chinese emerged over time because some scholars somewhere were too lazy to write out 麗 every time, and went with 丽 instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is: free yourself from &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; constraints about how your writing should be written. Start with a blank canvas if you like, and add in features as you see fit. Think about your proto-script and how the first scribes might have written things down - then think about how later writers would have abbreviated those forms and made them shorter, simpler and easier. As Artifexian says: Iterate, Iterate, Iterate. Write down random scribbles and see how they pair with your script.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few random ideas. I hope some of them help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;* I don't know how your language works, but you might not even need to separate sentences.

If the number of possible sounds per syllable is limited, then limiting syllables is going to be one of the main challenges. Some approaches to limit syllables are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assign a separate &lt;strong&gt;meaning to every possible syllable&lt;/strong&gt; that could be pronounced. It's best if the meanings are as distant as possible from each other.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid synonyms&lt;/strong&gt;, similar to the previous point, where multiple different sounds map to the same meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allow for things like optional &lt;strong&gt;contractions&lt;/strong&gt;, that shorten the spelling or pronunciation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;strict word order&lt;/strong&gt; rules, as opposed to grammatical particles/prefixes/suffixes, when possible. If a subject is always at the beginning of a sentence, it won't need to be marked as a subject, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When deriving new words by combining existing ones, use very &lt;strong&gt;small fragments of root words&lt;/strong&gt; as opposed to the whole thing. For example, instead of &lt;code&gt;sand + castle --&amp;gt; sandcastle&lt;/code&gt;, do &lt;code&gt;sand + castle --&amp;gt; sandle/sastle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In addition to assigning meaning to syllables, an extreme approach would be to go down to the letter level, approximate &lt;strong&gt;meanings for each letter&lt;/strong&gt;.

I am sure other languages have features like these. Grammatical nuances like these could be done by punctuation in writing.

Every language's rules leaves ambiguity somewhere; you just choose where. Perhaps your language has ambiguity in novel places, and so in the less expressive writing media would need a novel mark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also have not-exactly-punctuation symbols. Consider where you might have a culturally important mark like $, or a short-hand mark like &amp;amp;.

For a comparison that shows how a word having multiple purposes could denote verblessness, see how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salishan_languages#Nounlessness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Salishan Languages&lt;/a&gt; can be considered nounless:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Words with noun-like meanings are automatically equivalent to [be + NOUN] when used predicatively, such as Lushootseed sbiaw which means '(is a) coyote'. Words with more verb-like meanings, when used as arguments, are equivalent to [one that VERBs] or [VERB+er]. For example, Lushootseed ʔux̌ʷ means '(one that) goes'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In natural languages, where words evolve in meaning over time, you can see meanings change over time. See how the words Be, Is and Am come about:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Old English bēon, an irregular and defective verb, whose full conjugation derives from several originally distinct verbs. The forms am and is are from an Indo-European root shared by Latin sum and est . The forms was and were are from an Indo-European root meaning ‘remain’. The forms be and been are from an Indo-European root shared by Latin fui ‘I was’, fio ‘I become’, and Greek phuein ‘bring forth, cause to grow’. The origin of are is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- Google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be possible to make a language where your verb is a primarily a noun/adjective/adposition but can be considered a verb only secondarily, as it's meaning changes over the imaginary history of the language. Maybe the word LA primarily means SEAT or GROUND (specifically a noun, not another verb). But when it's used with another word, it's meaning changes from the noun to a verb-like sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This way you could have a verbless language, where it's verb-like words evolved out of non-verbs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Kēlen has no such evolution of relationals, so they can serve no other purpose than to be one for one verb replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="761" LastActivityDate="2021-06-14T11:30:58.073" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

All languages change over time, and as parts of the same language get separated geographically (or socially), they diverge. At some point they have diverged so much that they become separate languages (after having been different dialects/sociolects of the same language).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are no 'languages': all there is is the capability of an individual to transfer mental phenomena/thoughts into speech, and the reverse capability of transferring speech back into thoughts. This is negotiated by individuals, and if they can successfully communicate, they speak the same 'language'. My speech changes when I always speak with the same group of people, and when I then meet someone from another group I haven't seen for a while, communication might be more difficult, as we use different words or pronounce words differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some languages get preserved, mainly for ritualistic reasons: if you believe that your words invoke magic, or address a deity, you are careful about not changing this, as the words might lose their power. This relates to your 'old' variant. A writing system also helps to ossify a language, so Latin and Ancient Greek still exist (but notice how modern Greek and all the Romance languages have evolved from them).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Languages are commonly traced back to proto-languages (like indo-european), but a lot of this is conjecture, and made difficult by the lack of evidence (spoken variants are not usually preserved over time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So languages differ if they are isolated from each other. Geography is a strong factor, so mountain villages often have their own dialects. Similarly with islands (though trade would then link them up again). Social class is also important: if peasants don't talk to knights or aristocrats, their language (sociolects) will grow apart. A writing system (if there is sufficient literacy) might slow that down, especially use of different words, while purely spoken languages would diverge faster between separate groups. Isolated countries are also different from countries that are well-connected with their neighbours. Shared culture also preserves linguistic coherence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, social factors can also play a role: you might want to imitate a higher-prestige sociolect, and your language then changes as well. Many learners of English want to speak with a British accent, but are mostly exposed to American English through films etc, so they might speak a mixture of American and British English. These might then become different dialects and eventually languages (though English-speaking cultural domination would preserve some cohesiveness here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there are plenty of options for you to decide how and why your languages diverge, based on the civilisation you want to model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="307" LastEditorUserId="307" LastEditDate="2021-06-25T15:49:39.207" LastActivityDate="2021-06-25T15:49:39.207" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In Esperanto, as elemtilas said, there are roots which are combined into words — effectively similar to toki pona, only with no spaces in-between:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;English: &lt;em&gt;queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Esperanto: &lt;em&gt;reĝino&lt;/em&gt;  (&lt;em&gt;-in-&lt;/em&gt; indicates 'female')&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;toki pona: &lt;em&gt;jan lawa meli&lt;/em&gt; ('person' 'lead' 'female')&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;English has a single &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;morpheme&lt;/a&gt;, Esperanto has three morphemes, and so does toki pona. But both Esperanto and English have one word, wheras toki pona has three. So the question of the number of words is not really all that meaningful, as it depends on the structure of your language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real question is how many morphemes you need, but even then it's difficult. In toki pona you can combine morphemes to form bigger elements, and each morpheme arguably has a whole range of meanings; from the context you choose the one that is most likely. The word &lt;em&gt;lili&lt;/em&gt; means little, small, young, etc. so you cannot know whether &lt;em&gt;jan lili&lt;/em&gt; is a young person or a small one. You will typically know from context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when thinking about vocabulary size there are several aspects to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Language structure: do you have self-standing morphemes that are combined to phrases (like toki pona), morphemes that are stuck together in compound words (like Esperanto), or single morphemes that express multiple meanings at once (like English &lt;em&gt;king&lt;/em&gt;: 'ruler' and 'male' vs &lt;em&gt;queen&lt;/em&gt;: 'ruler' and 'female'). If — like Esperanto — you stick to one basic meaning component per morpheme, then the gender of the ruler would have to be expressed in a different morpheme (or it could be omitted altogether). The same also applies to verbs and tenses, pronouns, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Specificity: How accurate do you want your language to be? If you want to be able to express exact meanings, then you need different morphemes. In English there are many words such as &lt;em&gt;Earl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Duke&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Count&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Margrave&lt;/em&gt;, etc. which in toki pona would just be &lt;em&gt;jan lawa&lt;/em&gt; ('leader'). Toki pona is good for epics, where such distinctions are not relevant, but if you want to write a detailed history of the Norman conquest, then maybe choose a different language.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Target domain: It also makes a difference what you want to use your language for. If it is an intergalactic &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to be used for trading, then you'd need to be specific about prices and descriptions of objects, but not so much about family relationships. Klingon famously has a vocabulary dominated by words related to fighting and killing, so it might be hard to write a love poem in it (though not impossible). A general purpose language needs to be able to express a wider range of meanings than a domain-specific one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Overall complexity of your language: How many cases do you have? How many numbers? Grammatical genders? Any such feature needs to be expressed in some way, which could result in more words. If you have singular/dual/plural, you might need three pronouns &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;us-two&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;us-more-than-two&lt;/em&gt;. But you could choose not to have that at all and simply use &lt;em&gt;us-any-number-from-one-to-many&lt;/em&gt;. Hawai'ian has a different set of pronouns to distinguish between &lt;em&gt;us all, including you&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;us all, but not you&lt;/em&gt;. If you have a politeness system based on relative ages, then you might want to distinguish between &lt;em&gt;you-who-is-younger-than-me&lt;/em&gt; and a more polite &lt;em&gt;you-who-is-older-than-me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aesthetics: you can make do with one word for &lt;em&gt;move-from-A-to-B&lt;/em&gt;. And one word for &lt;em&gt;ingest&lt;/em&gt;. But any story you write will quickly become very boring, as you will use the same word over and over again. So you want &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt; to introduce some variation (see the remarks about Klingon above). The more synonyms you have, the more words. They're not strictly necessary, but make your language more pleasant to use. In AI, the opposite is actually used to make it easier for computers to handle events: you have a small set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_dependency_theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;semantic primitives&lt;/a&gt; for the basic events (movement, transfer of objects, etc). But you wouldn't want to read such representations for fun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarise: The right number of words for a conlang is how many you need for it to work, given the purpose and structure of the language. It is a bit of an irrelevant question, really, because you won't know that you have enough words until you're happy that your language is usable. And even then, new words are likely to develop over time. In my view, number of words is not a useful metric when developing a language, unless you want to use it as a constraint (as in toki pona).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="307" LastEditorUserId="307" LastEditDate="2021-07-01T09:35:45.140" LastActivityDate="2021-07-01T09:35:45.140" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you have additional structures, you'll have additional places of articulation, and if you're missing some structures you'll have fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now methods of articulation. There are four main articulators involved in speech, each of which allows for the production of sounds in a different set of places of articulation. These are the lips, the tongue, the pharynx, &amp;amp; the glottis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each articulator can produce a variety of gestures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Complete closure: this gives stops, taps, and trills&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Close restriction: this gives fricatives&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Open restriction: this gives approximants and vowels&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tongue, and to a lesser extent the lips are very flexible and can contact multiple places of articulation. In humans, the lips can contact the other lip, or the teeth, whilst the tongue can contact anything from the lips to the uvula. If your elves have especially short lips, or lack the overbite common in humans today, they might find labiodontals difficult and lack them, and if they have short tongues, they are unlikely to have linguolabials, or even dentals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these articulators are able to form a variety of shapes and can use different parts of themselves to make the articulation. This gives the difference between retroflex and alveolar consonants (are you contacting with the top of the tongue, the tip, or even the bit just below the tip), between sibilants &amp;amp; non-sibilants (is the tongue flat or grooved), and between laterals and non-laterals (is the restriction made with the edges of the tongue or the centre). In natural languages, these shape contrasts are only observed with the tongue as articulator, but if your elves have especially bendy lips, they might be able to produce analogous contrasts with their lips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The glottis and pharynx are fairly restricted due to their very nature, both only being able to act in their respective place of articulation, but you do have some freedom here in terms of what articulations they can actually produce. Human glottises can produce stops or fricatives, but the pharynx cannot produce stops. Perhaps your elves are able to fully close their pharynx (not only would this allow for pharyngeal stops, it would also allow for a new secondary articulation, intermediate between clicks, which use a velar closure, and ejectives, which use a glottal closure).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In humans, because our jaws are hinged at the back, fully open restriction is only really possible from the soft palate forwards. This is why the distinction between approximants and fricatives starts getting fuzzy around the uvula and back, the open restriction &amp;amp; close restriction are just too nearby for the clumsy back of the tongue, or the pharynx, or glottis to reliably distinguish them (likewise, vowels are articulated exclusively in the space between the alveolar ridge and soft palate). If your elves have mouths that swing open in such a way that the back is as open as the front, they might be able to reliably distinguish uvula fricatives from approximants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these main articulators, there are a couple of other things to consider. These are the vocal chords and the nasal cavity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vocal chords give you the ability to distinguish voicing. Humans have tremendous control over our vocal chords allowing for languages that distinguish many different phonations (modal voicing, voiceless, creaky, breathy, etc), as well precise differences in voice onset time (voiced, tenuis, aspirated). If your elves have even finer control they may be able to distinguish even more levels, and if they have weaker control, they may distinguish fewer, or none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nasal cavity allows for nasal sounds. Gesturally, nasals aren't a separate method of articulation, but a secondary articulation on top of a voiced stop (the same secondary articulation that would go on a nasalised vowel, approximant, or fricative). In nasalised sounds, the very back of the soft palate (around the uvular) lowers, allowing air to enter it at the same time as it enters the mouth, this adds an additional resonating chamber giving an extra overtone visible in a waveform. Because the back of the soft palate has to lower to produce them, nasals are most easily produced forward in the mouth, are difficult on the soft palate, and impossible further back than the uvula. If your elves' nasal cavity connects further forwards than humans, they might find velar or even palatal nasals difficult, if it connects further back, they might find uvular nasals easy, and have an additional series of pharyngeal nasals even further back that they can produce but find difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any other changes to the vocal tract will affect the timbre of the sounds produced, but not what the sounds actually are at a gestural level (or how they would likely be perceived by a human with some exposure to the language). Many of the changes discussed above (especially adding or removing structures from the vocal tract) will also affect the timbre. As it is, it sounds like all the differences between your elf vocal tract and a human one are of this type.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2711" LastActivityDate="2021-07-26T10:44:22.977" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In a minimal–augmented system, each person comes in two pronominal forms: &lt;em&gt;minimal&lt;/em&gt;, which is singlar for 1, 2 and 3, but dual for 1+2; and &lt;em&gt;augmented&lt;/em&gt;, which is more than minimal. Slotting your pronominal table into this system gives the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&quot;s-table-container&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;table class=&quot;s-table&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Minimal&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Augmented&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1+3+3+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1+2&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1+2+3+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;2+2+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;3+3+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But now that I look at this table, I notice something odd. See, the augmented form of 3 is many 3s, and the augmented form of 2 is many 2s. But the augmented form of 1 refers to many 3s! This is odd, especially considering that a first person plural pronoun is usually 1+1+… — no need to drag random third persons into it. Similarly, your augmented 1+2 pronoun should be many first and second persons, without third persons. Thus, your 1+2+2+… form should be the &lt;em&gt;augmented 1+2&lt;/em&gt; pronoun:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&quot;s-table-container&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;table class=&quot;s-table&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Minimal&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Augmented&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1+1+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1+2&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;1+2+1+2+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;2+2+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;3+3+…&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, if you prefer, you can shoehorn it into a more ‘traditional’ form and call it a first person inclusive plural:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/dnXLc.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/dnXLc.png&quot; alt=&quot;table of minimal/augmented pronouns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2729" LastActivityDate="2021-08-26T04:17:27.483" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For a start, some languages have ‘verbal classifiers’ (Aikhenvald 2000). These are a set of incorporated nouns or dedicated affixes which agree with a verbal argument, most commonly the S/O argument. Such a system will certainly be mostly or entirely orthogonal to the gender system, so is useful for further disambiguation. Even 5 or so verbal classifiers — a very small number — is enough to give a reasonable number of class/classifier combinations: (I denote the noun classes in uppercase and verbal classifiers in lowercase)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1sg-ERG cat(I,i)-ABS mouse(II,i)-ABS i-see-PRS-I NEG-i-see-PRS-II&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, I see no reason why the  verb should agree only with the absolutive argument in noun class (cf Bantu), so let’s add some polypersonal agreement for further disambiguation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1sg-ERG cat(I,i)-ABS mouse(II,i)-ABS i-see-PRS-I-1sg NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go further. In some languages, alignment is lexically determined by the verb used. Though this usually occurs with agreement affixes, one can imagine a system where there are several possibilities for case-marking of intransitive and transitive verbs, with the verb retaining its transitivity. This adds extra information when two verbs are juxtaposed with their arguments interleaved. In this case, it seems reasonable for a verb like ‘see’ to take absolutive–dative marking (or absolutive–accusative, or nominative–accusative, if you like):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1sg-ABS cat(I,i)-DAT mouse(II,i)-DAT i-see-PRS-I-1sg NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go further. It is common for converbal constructions to specify whether the verb is same-subject or different-subject with respect to the main verb, or following clause in the case of clause chaining. Of course, the converbal affix only attaches to the verb itself. However, the Australian language Kayardild has a rather odd construction in which an oblique case is suffixed to nearly every single word of a different-subject complement clause (Evans 1995). This gives me enough precedent to postulate a system wherein a same-subject or different-subject affix is added to every word of the relevant clause:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1sg-ABS-SS cat(I,i)-DAT-SS mouse(II,i)-DAT i-see-PRS-I-SS NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, converbs already allow a certain amount of discontinuity in the main clause: e.g. &lt;em&gt;the man, being a traitor, was tried by the king&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go further. Negative concord allows the negative to be marked several different times within the clause (e.g. dialectal &lt;em&gt;I ain’t got no money&lt;/em&gt;). It is straightforward to state that e.g. the negative prefix must be applied to both the absolutive argument and the verb:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1sg-ABS-SS cat(I,i)-DAT-SS NEG-mouse(II,i)-DAT i-see-PRS-I-SS NEG-i-see-PRS-II-1sg&#xA;I see the cat, but don't see the mouse.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these together then give enough leeway to do stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;mouse(II,i)-ABS-SS NEG-mouse(II,i)-ABS-DS i-chase-PST-II-I-SS NEG-i-catch-PST-II-I-DS cat(I,i)-ERG-SS, 1sg-ABS-SS rat(II,ii)-DAT-SS cat(I,i)-ABS-DS ii-see-PST-II-SS i-tell-PST-I-1sg-DS, ii-catch-PST-II-I-SS i-get.bored-PST-I rat(II,ii)-ABS-SS cat(I,i)-ERG-SS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cat chased a mouse, but didn’t catch it; I saw a rat, and told the cat. The cat caught the rat but got bored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Warning: I’m a bit unsure as to whether some of the nouns should take SS or DS marking, but it should be fine as is.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2729" LastActivityDate="2021-08-26T14:25:43.790" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Hence my answer is not so much about Ido in particular, but conlangs in general.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Esperanto is widely spoken all over the world, and is thus practically useful for communication; less widely used languages either have their own enthusiasts' communities (eg toki pona). Other, more obscure languages won't have that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But they can still be useful in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;expanding your horizon: learning a new language gets you to think in a different way (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;) from your native one. This is one reason toki pona was designed the way it was: the limited vocabulary forces you to shed aspects of meaning that are not essential for what you want to say. Klingon has a very lop-sided vocabulary, which again makes it easy to express some aspects, but hard to reason about others. This applies both to natural languages (through attached cultures) and constructed languages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;easier language learning: this is especially valid for Esperanto. A conlang is often more regular, so learners can learn about concepts of linguistics without worrying too much about exceptions to myriad rules. There is an actual programme (whose name escapes me) where Esperanto is taught as the first foreign language to school kids. This makes it easier for them to learn subsequent languages and they progress faster (even taking into account the additional time of learning Esperanto)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in-group communication: if you and your friends share an obscure conlang, you can use it to communicate in secret in public. Or you might find it easier to talk about a shared hobby (eg going to the extreme of jargon use by turning it into a language). Or you could write a secret diary in it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;more concise expression: in computing you have the concept of DSLs (domain specific languages). You can design a conlang which is suited specifically for a particular purpose (expressing emotions, describing inter-personal relationships, mathematics, etc). Natural languages are general purpose languages, but with a conlang you can hone in on areas that you are interested in, and ignore others. This again relates to linguistic relativity in a way.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;game/recreational use: you can use a conlang as an 'exotic' language for NPC in games to make them more realistic. The player can then pick up the language (or learn it, if it is a more well-known conlang) and communicate with the NPCs. Or you could write songs in a conlang (who understands song lyrics anyway!) Or write poetry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally found Esperanto easy to learn, and when learning other European languages you notice a cross-over in vocabulary. As I learned other languages before, it didn't really give me a better understanding of languages per se (I'd actually studied linguistics by that time already), but I can imagine that it makes it easier to acquire natural languages.

If you're doing this though, you need to be aware of the stage in the language's development you're borrowing into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this approach, you could do what Arabic and Hebrew did and borrow Middle Persian pwlʾpt' (pōlāwad), possibly as something like pūlâdu-, and then apply whatever sound changes would be expected to occur since the borrowing (if any).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also coin a word based on native roots, looking at the etymologies for the missing words in related or nearby languages (this technique was used a lot in the revival of Hebrew).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this approach, your word for steel might be kûnu- (possibly phonemically kônu-, if there was an o phoneme) from the verb kânu &amp;quot;to be firm&amp;quot;, following the same etymology as that of English &amp;quot;steel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other of your major choices is to look at the word in related languages, and construct what the Akkadian cognate would be, had the word existed at the Proto-Semitic stage (something that certainly would not have been the case here, seeing as Proto-Semitic predates the discovery of steel or most of mathematics by quite some time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I can't use &amp;quot;steel&amp;quot; as an example here very well, because most of the nearby Semitic languages borrowed their word from Persian. Instead lets look at &amp;quot;equation&amp;quot;. Here the Arabic word is مُعَادَلَة muʿādala, a verbal noun of a Form III verb. Form III verbs in Arabic (which promote the indirect object of a Form I verb to their direct object) do not have a direct cognate class in Akkadian, but the Gt-stem has the closest semantics in this case. The equivalent construction then might be something like tedāltu-.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I say, which approach you should take depends on your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Borrowing from a modern hegemonic language is probably the easiest if you just want to make it usable today, and aren't interested in some alternate history for the language where it survived.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Borrowing from a formerly hegemonic language on the other hand, is good if you are interested in that alternate history, and intend to apply various sound changes from the historical Akkadian to your present day form.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coining the word from native roots also works well if you're not interested in alternate history, but is likely to make it harder for other people to learn. This method has historically been popular only when there is already a community who uses the language (in at least some contexts), rather than those where someone is trying to build the community from the ground up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Constructing plausible cognates tends to make the most sense for accidental gaps in the lexicon where a word did presumably exist, in other instances it would be pretty unusual.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2711" LastActivityDate="2021-10-15T10:17:49.387" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

What is language? I would define natural language loosely as the normal languages that we know: English, Spanish, etc. But mathematics is more about the study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;formal systems&lt;/a&gt; involving formal languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The divide between natural and formal language is especially evident in the impossibility of translation between them. For example, consider the formal system of chess with a formal language of pieces, moves, etc. It’s impossible to translate a natural language expression like “I love you” into chess moves without extreme contrivance. In the other direction a sequence of chess moves has no inherent meaning outside of chess. There’s plenty of natural language around chess in discussion, explanation, description, etc. But the internal language of chess is formal and strictly limited to chess. Set theory, a popular mathematical framework, is quite similar. You can't naturally say &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; with sets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that formal languages can be translated between each other in some sense similar to natural language. For example, chess or Magic the Gathering can be &amp;quot;translated&amp;quot; into a turing machine (ie. played on a computer).

You seem to be coming from the other direction, trying to replicate the &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; and not the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; of English verb constructions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would think of what you want to say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;semantic content: this is done by choosing a particular verb (eat, go, plan)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pragmatics: be judgemental/evaluative (talk/chat/gossip/converse/...)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;modality: how likely is it? Do I have to do it? Am I abble to do it? In English you use modal verbs for that (can, would, should, must)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tense: when does it happen? Past, future, present? This is done by modals (will) or morphology (planned, ate, went)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;link with subject/object: for redundancy, do you want to have shared features between the subject or object and the verb? I eat, but she eats. You could be inventive and have the verb agree with the object (*I eat a burger, *I eats two burgers)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to express any of this (apart from the semantic aspect) through the verb. You could have separate words that signal any of these, or use word order: if the verb is before the noun, then it means you disapprove of what happened, if it is after, you're fine with it (that would be an odd example, but hey, it's &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; language and you can do what you want to).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or you could have affixes that you attach to the words (which is like regular past tense markers in English).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some verbs (and nouns) take complements, eg anything related to planning/thinking. Or other verbs that relate to actions: &lt;em&gt;I'm waiting to start&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;I'm waiting for Godot to arrive&lt;/em&gt;.

It's easy to handle single-word nouns (translating from English), because, well, they are one word. An example of a single word noun is &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot;. In my case, I just prefix them with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. But it gets more complex when you consider more complex multi-word nouns. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big old tree.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;The big old oak tree.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;The tree leaf forest.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;The dirt path.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;The dirt path area.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;The town grocery store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All my examples are where there is a main noun at the end, and everything else comes after the &lt;code&gt;The&lt;/code&gt; (it prefixes the noun). But I'm sure there are examples you could come up with where everything else comes after (or surrounds) the key noun, I can't think of any off the top of my head for English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first one consists of what are traditionally called &lt;strong&gt;adjectives&lt;/strong&gt; I think. As &lt;code&gt;big&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; are just simple adjectives. Adjectives are known as &amp;quot;noun modifiers&amp;quot;. In my foobar (fake, for demonstration purposes) conlang, adjectives are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, so it makes it easy: &lt;code&gt;ubig uold atree&lt;/code&gt;. Cool, that should work...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then it gets more complicated. &amp;quot;Oak tree&amp;quot; is a type of thing. You could say &amp;quot;oak&amp;quot; is an adjective, but is it really? I don't know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then it gets even more complicated. The phrase &lt;code&gt;tree leaf forest&lt;/code&gt; should probably be written &lt;code&gt;tree-leaf forest&lt;/code&gt;, but when speaking you don't denote hyphens, so there's that. But all 3 of these words themselves (standalone) are nouns (&amp;quot;tree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;forest&amp;quot;). So do I mark them as noun-after-noun, or a bunch of adjectives followed by a single trailing noun. That is the key question I am asking, is it the pattern (in English or any other language), that the noun is either &lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;by some principle&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;a single word&lt;/strong&gt; (like the trailing &lt;code&gt;forest&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;tree leaf forest&lt;/code&gt;) and the rest are adjectives? Or how should we think of this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;code&gt;dirt path area&lt;/code&gt; has the same exact problem. What is to be a noun, what is to be a noun-modifier? Because &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dirt&amp;quot; are very different, &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; on its own is an adjective/noun-modifier, while &amp;quot;dirt&amp;quot; on its own is a noun (&amp;quot;old path forest&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;dirt path forest&amp;quot;), shouldn't they be distinguished in some way in theory? By that I mean, grammatically classified differently?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last case, &amp;quot;grocery store&amp;quot; is the noun, so there is a case where actually, it's not the trailing single one-word noun that should be marked as a noun, it is the 2 word phrase &amp;quot;grocery store&amp;quot; that should be marked as a whole noun. But preceding &amp;quot;grocery store&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;town&amp;quot;, which is also (standalone) a noun, but in this case acting as an adjective. But really, &amp;quot;grocery&amp;quot; is the &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; of store, so store is the noun, and grocery is the adjective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are cases where the noun is 3 words, but I can't think of any (&amp;quot;coffee shop&amp;quot; is 2, &amp;quot;full moon&amp;quot;, or perhaps 3 would be &amp;quot;assistant state secretary&amp;quot;). Oh but then you have &amp;quot;assistant state secretary Jane Doe&amp;quot;. In the first case you have &amp;quot;secretary&amp;quot; as the trailing noun (&amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;, being adjectives I guess?), but in the second one &amp;quot;secretary&amp;quot; is now an adjective? And &amp;quot;Jane Doe&amp;quot; is the noun?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically the question is, what counts as a noun when there are other seemingly-&amp;quot;modifiers&amp;quot; present around the noun, and what counts as a modifier?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2990" LastActivityDate="2021-12-16T12:02:19.813" Title="How to handle denoting the noun in a sentence when there are noun-modifiers present?"

Although Esperanto speakers would likely exploit the agglutinative properties of the language and use &lt;em&gt;seksskandalo&lt;/em&gt; if it were not for the difficult -kssk- consonant cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="395" LastActivityDate="2021-12-16T12:02:19.813" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I have to some degree (i.e. a little bit) studied the grammar of Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Sanskrit, and Hebrew, and know Spanish relatively well in comparison from school, though my main language is obviously English. By &amp;quot;study&amp;quot;, I don't know all of the grammatical structures of these languages, but I get some of the basics and have gathered inspiration from them. I have decided I like Chinese (Mandarin) and Vietnamese for the &amp;quot;atomicity&amp;quot; (analytical language), where every word is an atom and there are no word conjugations or the like, even for things like making it past tense (&amp;quot;wanted&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;want&amp;quot; in English).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But such an atomic/analytic language comes at a cost, you have an extra word for very common things like the past tense of a verb. So I am making some of these common things be turned into a suffix. But it turns out, just by making tenses, plurals, and a few other things into suffixes, it is already starting to look a lot like English  or Spanish. Also, I learned from Hebrew that they have the definite article (like &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; equivalent) prefix every word if you have a complex noun. I think that is repetitive, so I like the way English does it just saying &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; once at the beginning of a phrase. Now, Chinese doesn't use &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; at all, they omit the word entirely. I don't really like losing that extra information (even though in theory you can regain it from context, but I don't know Chinese well enough to see how this really &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; omitting the word &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;). So I am opting to have the concept of &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sanskrit has way more verb and noun inflections, but I want to keep most of the words atomic so I don't do anywhere near as many as they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That gets us through the words pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After all of this, we are left with sentence structure. I like the idea of SVO rather than VSO or VOS because SVO seems like (in principle) it &lt;em&gt;flows&lt;/em&gt; from one thing to the next, like a programming language. You start with the subject, it &amp;quot;pipes&amp;quot; into the verb as input, and then you pipe in the object from the other side. I mean technically with &amp;quot;piping&amp;quot; you might think &amp;quot;SOV&amp;quot; might make more sense, but splitting the subject and object with a verb means it's easier to distinguish between them. But this is, again, like how English (and Spanish and Chinese) does it. So it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like I haven't even looked at other languages to mix it up and not be so &amp;quot;English-centric&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So then my sentences are basically like English in the end (since I have &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, and SVO, with a few word suffixes):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;the&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tree&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fall&amp;gt; &amp;lt;down&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this gets to the main question. The last real big piece is how to deal with noun modifiers (&amp;quot;adjectives&amp;quot;) and verb modifiers (&amp;quot;adverbs&amp;quot;). In English, they appear &lt;em&gt;all over the place&lt;/em&gt; in the sentence. Sometimes they appear before the word (&amp;quot;the tree &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; fell&amp;quot;), sometimes after (&amp;quot;the tree fell &lt;strong&gt;down&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;). Sometimes both (&amp;quot;the tree &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; fell &lt;strong&gt;down&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;). That is for adverbs, but for adjectives too (&amp;quot;I see the *&lt;em&gt;big tree&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, which I guess is an &lt;em&gt;attributive&lt;/em&gt; adjective, vs. &lt;em&gt;predicative&lt;/em&gt; adjectives which I can't think of an example of adjective appearing after a noun).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering, what are all the ways these &amp;quot;inspiration&amp;quot; languages (in terms of my project) handle adjectives/adverbs (&amp;quot;modifiers&amp;quot;)? Are there any languages which greatly &lt;em&gt;restrict&lt;/em&gt; their placement in the sentence to only one position (either before or after the noun/verb)? If so, what are some examples in either Chinese, Vietnamese, Sanskrit, and/or Hebrew (or all 4 of them), of if they don't have that feature, what is a language that does (with an example)? If there is a good conlang which demonstrates it, that would be an interesting comment too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically I am trying to not make this language feel like &amp;quot;I just slightly modified English&amp;quot;. I thought about the word/sentence features of many other languages and feel I like this structure I have landed on the best so far, but there is still room for improvement and getting better/more &lt;em&gt;influence&lt;/em&gt; from these other few languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Sanskrit).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2990" LastActivityDate="2022-04-10T21:43:17.820" Title="How to break out of the English mold when creating a conlang (specifically in regards to word modifiers)?"

That's a very ambitious project though, and there are easier things you can do that takes you a long way!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Separate &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; to say from &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to say it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance: Being a native English speaker, you are accustomed to having a definite article in your language, as you like being able to separate &amp;quot;the cat&amp;quot; from just any other cat in every sentence. Fine. You know what you want to say. If you want your language to seem more exotic, ask yourself if the way the English language expresses this feature is the only way, or if you could come up with something else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My native language is Swedish, and we also make the distinction between definite and indefinite. We don't have a word like your &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, however, but instead use different endings to convey the same meaning. Much like English does with the plural. Consider the following translations from English to Swedish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;katt&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the cat&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;katten&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cats&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;katter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the cats&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;katterna&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started learning English at school I was faced with this strange structure (the English &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;), but the underlying concept was familiar. I could thus relatively seamlessly translate one construction to the other. If my native language had not had the same distinction it would likely have been much harder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention that you know some Spanish, and though definite articles work the same you could observe differences from English there as well. One is that pronouns are not necessary in a Spanish sentence, since this information is expressed in the verb endings. &amp;quot;Voy a comer&amp;quot; translates readily to &amp;quot;I'm going to eat&amp;quot;, but take a look at the two sentences and you'll find they are &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; different. The Spanish one has no pronoun. The English one has the unit &amp;quot;I'm&amp;quot;, which could either be interpreted as a pronoun and a verb not present in the Spanish one, or as a unit corresponding to Spanish &amp;quot;soy&amp;quot;. Then follows the word &amp;quot;going&amp;quot; which has the same basic meaning as Spanish &amp;quot;voy&amp;quot;, a word that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; used in the translation, but in a completely different form. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; translate &amp;quot;voy&amp;quot; to the English unit &amp;quot;I'll&amp;quot; and make the whole sentence &amp;quot;I'll eat&amp;quot;, but even then that doesn't constitute an exact word-by-word translation as the word &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; would have been taken out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: How could you express your desired distinction between definite and indefinite? One way would be to keep the article, but place it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the noun instead. You could use suffixes, like Scandinavian languages, or why not prefixes? Word order? Keep this particular feature the same as in English, but change something else? You have lots of possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same procedure can be used for other things you want your language to express.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A comment on SVO word order:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you really sure your interpreting this as the most &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; has noting to do with English being a SVO language? Couldn't you just as well argue that verb-first structures are &amp;quot;more like programming&amp;quot; in that you first state a function and then its inputs? And if not, wouldn't  your comparison to piping fit better with OVS word order? If I tell my terminal to &amp;quot;ls | grep .pdf&amp;quot; it first gets the list of files, the &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;, and then feeds this to grep, which could be seen as either the subject or the verb, which filters out the lines containing &amp;quot;.pdf&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3049" LastEditorUserId="3049" LastEditDate="2022-04-10T21:43:17.820" LastActivityDate="2022-04-10T21:43:17.820" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

At first I started by manually deriving the words from Hebrew/Arabic/Sanskrit/Greek/Latin/English/Spanish, but then found it to be too tedious and time-consuming, so I started just randomly assigning many of the words to a set of precomputed words which fit a specific pattern. The patterns are (c = consonant, v = vowel):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cv (2 letters, like &amp;quot;do&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cvc (3 letters, like &amp;quot;bol&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ccvc (4 letters, like &amp;quot;gran&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cvcc (4 letters, like &amp;quot;bord&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ccvcc (5 letters, like &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cvcvc (5 letters, like &amp;quot;tekal&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything except the 2-letter words is a &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; word form, which starts and ends with a consonant. Then there are these rules:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt;: make it into a noun&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt;: make it into a verb&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt;: make it into a &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; (modifier/adjective)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-aha&lt;/code&gt;: make noun into plural&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-iha&lt;/code&gt;: make verb into continuous (like &amp;quot;-ing&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-iho&lt;/code&gt;: make verb into past tense (like &amp;quot;-ed&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-ihi&lt;/code&gt;: make verb into future tense (like &amp;quot;will x&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;suffix &lt;code&gt;-oho&lt;/code&gt;: make feature into an adverb (like &amp;quot;-ly&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you can start combining words to make more complex words. There are things like &lt;code&gt;-tion&lt;/code&gt; (capturing the result of action, written as &lt;code&gt;xom&lt;/code&gt; by itself), or &lt;code&gt;-er&lt;/code&gt; (the person performing the action, written as &lt;code&gt;pum&lt;/code&gt; by itself). So you have for example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;meki&lt;/code&gt;: create&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mekixoma&lt;/code&gt;: creation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mekipuma&lt;/code&gt;: creator&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems all fine and well, with little ambiguity so far. But then I start running into trouble with the following I think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;prefix &lt;code&gt;na-&lt;/code&gt;: meaning &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nav&lt;/code&gt;: number 9 (happens to start with &lt;code&gt;na-&lt;/code&gt;, but not prefixed with &lt;code&gt;na-&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fod&lt;/code&gt;: &amp;quot;fold&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rod&lt;/code&gt;: &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;road&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you can have the word phrase &amp;quot;ninefold path&amp;quot; as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;navo&amp;gt; (feature/adjective) &amp;lt;fodo&amp;gt; (feature/adjective) &amp;lt;roda&amp;gt; (noun)&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;navofodoroda&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All is fine and well so far. We separate the words with their POS tag basically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But now say we add a word like &lt;code&gt;vofod&lt;/code&gt; (cvcvc), which isn't derived from &amp;quot;fold&amp;quot; (&lt;code&gt;fod&lt;/code&gt;), but means &lt;code&gt;voice&lt;/code&gt;. And say we want to say &amp;quot;without voice path&amp;quot;, that would be the same then! &lt;code&gt;navofodoroda&lt;/code&gt;. So now there is ambiguity!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darn, how do I avoid this? I already have a pretty strict word-formation structure/system, but it seems to break down even then. I don't get how to avoid such ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I could put constraints on what letters can be used to create words, but that seems like a nightmare, how do I know what to prevent and where? In that case, no word other than &lt;code&gt;na&lt;/code&gt; could start with or contain &lt;code&gt;na-&lt;/code&gt;. But that seems quite restrictive, I don't know. Do other natural languages do such a thing (or conlangs)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I do that, how many different ways am I going to have to put constraints on word structure, and given what? What are the key words that will restrict other word formations? I have no idea if this is the right track to go down...

Past vs non-past doesn't get an explicit marking here, but the next verb after this point in the sentence changes its form, so syntacticians generally say there's an invisible element which exists in that position and tells the next verb to change its form. This position in the sentence is generally called &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;, for &amp;quot;tense&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aspect and voice, on the other hand, are indicated by &lt;em&gt;auxiliary verbs&lt;/em&gt; in between &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; and the verb: it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; written, it &lt;em&gt;was being&lt;/em&gt; written, it &lt;em&gt;had been being&lt;/em&gt; written. This position in the sentence is sometimes called &amp;quot;Aux&amp;quot;, for &amp;quot;auxiliary&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some syntacticians claim that this is universally true. All languages work like English and have a &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; position and an &amp;quot;Aux&amp;quot; position and the &amp;quot;Aux&amp;quot; position is used to indicate aspect and voice. According to these syntacticians, if a language &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; indicate aspect with an auxiliary, it's because there's actually an &lt;em&gt;invisible hidden auxiliary&lt;/em&gt;, it's there but we can't see it. You may have run into these claims before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many other syntacticians, though, think this is stupid. Because many languages really don't seem to have auxiliary verbs for aspect like English does. In Latin and Ancient Greek, for example, it's marked directly on the verb:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currebam&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;I was running&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;cucurrī&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;I ran&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ἔφευγον &amp;quot;I was running&amp;quot;, ἔφυγον &amp;quot;I ran&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other languages, such as German (see jk's answer for examples), don't have any explicit marking for this sort of aspect distinction at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still others use something other than an auxiliary verb. Egyptian uses a preposition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;jw.f ꜣtp ꜥꜣ.f&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;he loads up his donkey&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;jw.f &lt;strong&gt;ḥr&lt;/strong&gt; ꜣtp ꜥꜣ.f&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;he &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; loading up his donkey&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ḥr&lt;/em&gt; is a preposition literally meaning &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;, derived from a noun meaning &amp;quot;face&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't go for the &amp;quot;every language actually works exactly like English&amp;quot; theory (most linguists nowadays don't), I suspect English is in the minority here.

It appears that natural languages evolve to do this out of necessity, reusing parts and attaching things to parts to extend them (&amp;quot;ex-&amp;quot; extend, extra, extravagant, &amp;quot;inter-&amp;quot;, etc.). But is it really necessary? What advantages does this provide us in language?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only advantages I can see is that it &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; can give use some &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;clue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as to the words meaning. But it will never give us an accurate definition of the word's meaning. So why even bother is my main question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, you might have &lt;code&gt;bi-&lt;/code&gt; meaning two, so you have biannual (2x per year) and biweekly (every two weeks (why not twice a week? another story lol)). So given you know &amp;quot;weekly&amp;quot; already, you might be able to guess that biweekly means twice a week or every two weeks or something. But even with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/words-that-start-with-bi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bi-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you might not have an accurate guess. For example, bible, biography, billing, all start with bi, yet don't mean two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my second point. Often times you have words which have the same spelling as the prefix (assuming we're talking about English), but which don't have any relation. &lt;strong&gt;Bene&lt;/strong&gt;ath, &lt;strong&gt;Bene&lt;/strong&gt;fit. Bell- (war), belligerent, bellyache, bell itself. &lt;em&gt;There are better examples out there.&lt;/em&gt; So this seems like, more than adding a degree of helpfulness, it actually adds more to the confusion overall. In the end you need to memorize the meaning of every word, and then you can backtrace/recover the meaning of the &amp;quot;etymological parts&amp;quot; from the definition of the whole. But then it's like, if we're building a conlang, what is the purpose of deriving words from smaller word parts? Other than to resemble natural languages and their evolutionary dirtiness perhaps, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that you would be better off just picking random words to mean different things. Especially for foundational concepts. So instead of &amp;quot;inter-x&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;internet&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;interconnected&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;interwoven&amp;quot;, you would just have &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot; (no &lt;code&gt;ba-&lt;/code&gt; prefix lol). So there is no relation derived from simpler parts, thus removing the confusion. But does this make it harder to learn a language? That is, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the prefixes/suffixes (as in these English examples) actually aid in understanding/memory in some way or sort? Maybe there is some benefit after all, I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important/useful is it to derive words from smaller parts in a conlang?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learnsanskrit.org/references/sandhi/internal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sandhi&lt;/a&gt; in Sanskrit (for combining words) seems related to this question in some way, is it necessary to do such a thing in a conlang though?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2990" LastEditorUserId="2990" LastEditDate="2022-01-04T08:45:24.223" LastActivityDate="2022-01-05T01:18:49.077" Title="How important/useful is it to derive words from smaller parts in a conlang?"

Turkish distinguishes 'a' from 'one' with word order &amp;quot;I saw [one] red [a] car,&amp;quot; changes the noun case to do what 'the' does in &amp;quot;I saw the car,&amp;quot; and lets the absence of {a, this, that} to indicate &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Car was red.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using omission and word order, you can also come up with something which is not explicitly related to markers of definiteness per se. If I understand the Ngiyambaa (Pama-Nyungan; New South Wales, Australia) example of doing without a 'the,' folks usually indicate 1st and 2nd person, so could indicate 3rd person by omission; therefore, when they do mark 3rd person, it also means 'the,' even though this marker's explicit job is not being a definite article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering, what are all the ways these &amp;quot;inspiration&amp;quot; languages&#xA;(in terms of my project) handle adjectives/adverbs (&amp;quot;modifiers&amp;quot;)?

For example, &amp;quot;must begin with a consonant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;can't include &lt;code&gt;/θ/&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;must end in a consonant other than &lt;code&gt;/h/&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; are all constraints. But the language would also include constraints like, say, &amp;quot;don't insert an &lt;code&gt;/h/&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (to keep &lt;code&gt;/h/&lt;/code&gt;s from appearing in random places). And the relative ranking of these constraints would determine what happens to foreign words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, maybe &amp;quot;must begin with a consonant&amp;quot; outranks &amp;quot;don't insert an extra &lt;code&gt;/ʔ/&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. So given the choice between letting a foreign word start with a vowel (violates the first constraint) and inserting an &lt;code&gt;/ʔ/&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning (violates the second constraint), speakers would choose the second option. Why an &lt;code&gt;/ʔ/&lt;/code&gt; rather than any other consonant? Well, maybe &amp;quot;don't insert a &lt;code&gt;/q/&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; outranks &amp;quot;don't insert an &lt;code&gt;/ʔ/&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; too, so inserting &lt;code&gt;/ʔ/&lt;/code&gt; is preferable to inserting &lt;code&gt;/q/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to optimality theorists, every language includes a vast, near-infinite set of these constraints, with a strict ranking, and speakers will unconsciously modify words to comply with them. One advantage of this explanation is that the same constraints are used for native words as for foreign words, so you don't have to invoke any special machinery to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't believe in OT (i.e. you prefer rule-based systems over constraint-based systems), you'll generally have a set of &lt;em&gt;repair rules&lt;/em&gt; that are invoked whenever a word violates a language's phonotactics. These rules are specific to each individual language, and their goal is to fix all the violations. If your phonotactics don't allow &lt;code&gt;/ħ/&lt;/code&gt;, for example, you might have a repair rule that says &amp;quot;replace &lt;code&gt;/ħ/&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;/h/&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. If your phonotactics require consonants at the start of a word, you might have a repair rule that says &amp;quot;insert &lt;code&gt;/ʔ/&lt;/code&gt; before an initial vowel&amp;quot;. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This explanation has the advantage that it clearly explains why all languages seem to have their own idiosyncratic repair rules, which aren't generally necessary for native words. For example, all Swahili words must end in a vowel. When a foreign word doesn't, an &lt;code&gt;/i/&lt;/code&gt; is generally inserted. An optimality theorist would say this is because of some special constraint that's never needed for native words, while a rule-based phonologist would say there's just a repair rule that inserts that &lt;code&gt;/i/&lt;/code&gt;. (Māori and Japanese similarly &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; require words to end in a vowel; Māori inserts &lt;code&gt;/a/&lt;/code&gt;, Japanese inserts &lt;code&gt;/u/&lt;/code&gt;.

I speak English as my first language, where most of our swear words are known as &amp;quot;potty language&amp;quot; &amp;amp; for good reason. Most of the English swears are about sex or the body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In French, the language of my dad's family, a bunch of the swears are evangelical. I'm not sure that's the right word. What I mean is that most curse words are about the church. Now there's an interesting point to be heard there! What do we call swears? &amp;quot;Spitting oaths&amp;quot;? Promises basically. Using the Lord's name in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the Lord's name in vain does NOT primarily mean &amp;quot;oh my god lol&amp;quot;, it means &amp;quot;I swear to God&amp;quot; or when you put your hand on the bible in a courtroom &amp;amp; say &amp;quot;I swear to speak the truth&amp;quot; or whatever. If you keep your word, then good for you. It is &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; when you swear on the bible or God's name &amp;amp; then break your promise/oath. So that might be why French swears are often religious. Similar to the religion argument, bad words are often called &amp;quot;curse&amp;quot; words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend watching this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGcDi0DRtU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGcDi0DRtU&lt;/a&gt; comedy sketch &amp;amp; I think he has done a few more acts about curse words too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had read a book series (Codex Alera) where they use &amp;quot;crows&amp;quot; as a swear word. I think this is because crows are a motif throughout the books &amp;amp; might have some sort of special power, which means that they always end up on battlefields, feasting on the carrion &amp;amp; fallen friends. I believe Carrion &amp;amp; Maggots might also be swears. &amp;quot;Crows take it/you&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;god-damn it/you&amp;quot;. They even just use &amp;quot;(oh) crows&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;(oh) heck/shit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They use &amp;quot;Bloody&amp;quot; (as in &amp;quot;bloody crows&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;holy shit/smokes/cow/crap&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bloody/fucking hell&amp;quot;) which is a word used in this world. Bloody is used as an intensifier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In relation to the religious swear/curse words, they also say &amp;quot;great furies&amp;quot; as in &amp;quot;oh my god&amp;quot;. The furies are basically (pokemon crossed with spirit guides crossed with the concept of animism) who give powers to the owners like bending in ATLA. The great furies are like the spirit who lives in the mountain &amp;amp; his wife the storm/wind/bad weather on top of the mountain. So they can swear by the Great Furies as the folks on earth say &amp;quot;I swear to the Fae&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;God help me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another concept to consider is slurs. Slurs are usually based on or used against marginalized communities. (Black people &amp;amp; any marginalized racial/cultural/ethnic group; down syndrome, autism, learning disabilities, &amp;amp; other mental illnesses, neurodivergencies, &amp;amp; disabilities; Romani/Roma (this one is actually a huge issue bc I know people &lt;strong&gt;named&lt;/strong&gt; the G slur); trans, gay, otherwise queer, &amp;amp; intersex; etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer your questions:&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;How many swear words should you have in a conlang,&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;You only really need one or two source words, but you can use as many as one curse for every noun, verb, &amp;amp; adjective you invent. You could also choose a source category (religion, sex, even smth like plants or careers). Having a category might be able to limit you to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and how are they designed?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I believe they usually come up naturally. Maybe through mistakes. Maybe some teen afraid of sexual maturity tries to desexualize things by thinking of different words (like &amp;quot;feet&amp;quot; in the bible, or maybe pull smth out of ur ass like &amp;quot;hawthorn berries&amp;quot;) &amp;amp; then they accidentally pavlov themself into sexualizing hawthorn berries &amp;amp; now hawthorn berries are a euphemism  for sex. As mentioned with the crows, they could be related to undesirable topics like death. In cultures where nudity is natural I would assume that sex swears are less common. (They sexualize people less in those cultures than cultures where modesty is the norm. Typically. I'm generalizing.) So if sex is a taboo topic, swears would be about sex. If death is a taboo topic, then swears about death would be more common. If the taboo topic is malicious magic, then curse words might actually be about curses! Slurs have more defined or easily assigned sources. Swears can be considered a subset of slang. I also had a thought while answering one of the later questions: Things that used to be ok are now slurs because the people are still hated. &amp;quot;coloured&amp;quot; used to be the correct term, but since society still hated POC it stopped being a proper term. &amp;quot;L**e&amp;quot; used to be the used term, but it is a slur, so people started using &amp;quot;handicapped&amp;quot;, but that term also started feeling offensive &amp;amp; now &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot; is the correct term. It is in part due to inaccuracies in language I suppose. Like how &amp;quot;hermaphrodite&amp;quot; is a perfectly useful term for hermaphroditic animals but is not an accurate term for humans (with disorders/differences in sexual development or who are intersex). This is more slur based than swear based though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is their purpose really?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Their purpose is to emphasize. I don't usually swear, but sometimes, sometimes there is a situation that really warrants an oath. Promises (swear to god) are used to create honesty &amp;amp; binding. As in they are bound to their word. I think swears are also used as catharsis or emotional indicators. You use swears when you're angry, when you're courting someone, when you're really really excited... They are for emphasis, usually emotional. That's my opinion at least! My experience is my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And should any other &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; words be constructed out of them?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Like if &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; was a swear word, then &amp;quot;foobar&amp;quot; was a goose or &amp;quot;barfoo&amp;quot; was a house,&amp;quot;&#xA;I think maybe the other way around? As a mentally ill baker I deal with the term &amp;quot;retarded fermentation&amp;quot; because the word &amp;quot;retard&amp;quot; (the e is pronounced like &amp;quot;look&amp;quot;) means &amp;quot;late&amp;quot;. Tardy. I mentioned I speak french lol. A retarded fermentation is a fermentation (in sourdough) that takes extra long to develop more flavour. Slow. Late. When this term applies to a person, it means they are &amp;quot;mentally slow&amp;quot; I guess. Which is kind of true. You know how your brain is not fully developed until age 26? A ton of mentally ill/neurodivergent people don't finish brain development until age 30 ish. I think that it is more likely that words (that have related words) turn into slurs. Whether or not the related words are considered slurs is really a societal/cultural thing &amp;amp; can depend on the worldview of the people. Sam hill versus damn hell? Idk. One last thing to note: Basement is not a sexual word even though it has &amp;quot;semen&amp;quot; in the spelling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is that a problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;It depends. I said it was a cultural thing. If you use a slur in a hockey name (Like the new york n*****s or smth) then yes that is a problem &amp;amp; a slur! If the word &amp;quot;semen&amp;quot; is in the word &amp;quot;basement&amp;quot; then no that is not an issue, they have different etymologies. For things like &amp;quot;retarded fermentation&amp;quot;? Well that's a touchy one. I dislike the term because the source word is now used as a slur, but it was chosen for its accuracy. Maybe changing it to &amp;quot;Fermentation retardé&amp;quot; would be better because it has a different pronunciation &amp;amp; placement &amp;amp; maybe that would be enough. For words like &amp;quot;asshole&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;anus&amp;quot; I would say that yes it is still considered a swear word because the first part, &amp;quot;ass&amp;quot; is used &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt; it is a dirty word for bum. &amp;quot;pussy hair&amp;quot; would also be considered like that because it is the hair of the swear word, unlike pubic hair which is a perfectly fine term. So in general I would say it depends on how the words relate &amp;amp; how society reacts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, what are swear words actually,&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I feel like I answered this ok throughout this answer. A swear word is a word with a connotation of unprofessionalism that is used colloquially to add emotional emphasis. Although the connotation of swears/swearing can change throughout cultures &amp;amp; time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do they have a consistent meaning across cultures?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Ah yes I just answered this! They do not have a consistent meaning! From my experience they have the connotation of rudeness &amp;amp; emphasis, but to other cultures they can be related more to spiritual impurity or the keeping of promises. They almost definitely have even more meanings in other cultures &amp;amp; languages.

Were I not looking for other solutions, I would ask 'how do you order sentences to create paragraphs?', but this assumes structures like sentences and paragraphs. It seems most writing systems indicate the flow of thoughts and ideas by have a general rule, like always reading &amp;quot;from left to right, top to bottom&amp;quot; (Indo-European), &amp;quot;from bottom to top, left to right&amp;quot; (Japanese), or &amp;quot;along the line&amp;quot; (Ogham).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are curious, this constructed language is built around the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_diagram&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;sentence diagramming&lt;/a&gt;. Add to regular diagramming the option to branch new diagrams off of words already in your diagram, and you can chain these to express paragraphs as networks of connecting ideas.

You assume the existence of sentences and paragraphs already, but I think we should quickly look at them for efficiency sake. We generally learn to write a text, like an essay or a thesis, beginning with the thesis statement, the sort of summation of the whole problem the essay addresses. This is considered to be &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the statement a reader is to comprehend first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Next down from the entire essay in hierarchy is the paragraph. Likewise, we're taught to begin each one with the main sentence, that one that introduces the main idea to be discussed or revealed in that paragraph. Lastly in the hierarchy are sentences themselves. Interestingly, we don't order sentences &amp;quot;logically&amp;quot; but rather grammatically. Even though one might write a dissertation in Latin and put the thesis statement first, the sentence itself might not actually get to the point until you get to the verb way down at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This scheme is both Linear in the spatio-temporal sense and Top Down in the hierarchical sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt;, we could consider extending this basic scheme by standardising and increasing the power of punctuation and section markings. Many technical documents do this by noting every paragraph with what amounts to a unique serial number. Often in historical grammars we find references to things like P4a.2.N3 which denotes paragraph four-A (a subset of lesser importance than para 4 itself), section 2, note 3. All in all , a very low importance reference as it's relegated to a foot or end note.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have lots of interesting, unusual and unused punctuation marks that could be regularised, standardised and ammended to fulfil several key roles from marking importance to speculation or editorialisation. We have things like interrobangs and exclamation commas and the like; some languages have sectional punctuation. All of these could be incorporated into the existing scheme relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thirdly&lt;/strong&gt;, we should take a look at other systems entirely different. First, let's take a look at music and in specific the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.approachtoconducting.com/en/capitolo.php?section=7&amp;amp;subsection=41&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;conductor's score&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike an individual musician, the conductor has access to all the parts that are playing at any moment in the piece of music. Very much like what you're looking for, the conductor needs to be aware at any moment of &amp;quot;what is to be comprehended first&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how does the whole text flow&amp;quot;. Although music itself is linear, and the most important theme or idea isn't necessarily the first thing you hear!, the reader of the score needs to comprehend all the different sections, moving parts, thematic ideas and when they all occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRpJs.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRpJs.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you look in the images in the link, the conductor has marked up the &amp;quot;text&amp;quot; of the music by coordinating various divisions by colour, notes when various themes, motifs and entrances occur and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even in an individual musician's score or in a piano work, you'll find plenty of &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; markings: dynamic changes, pedal settings, phrasal markings, accentuation types as well as stylistic &amp;amp; tempo markings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some types of music rely heavily on flow marking, for example the genre of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-xTvfr3nJ8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;unmeasured music&lt;/a&gt;. Melodic and harmonic flow are indicated by the composer through the use of sweeping and flowing lines, but the interpretation and execution of the flow is the work of the player.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/aualE.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/aualE.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another system to look at is hypertext. We've all used it when we hover over highlighted key words and clicked on links to supporting data. And we've all wondered why the composer chose to link two things together that don't make sense just because the other word is spelled the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This system allows the writer to make use of the linear nature of reading to ensure that more important topics are marked and read first, but also allows freedom to move between sections and also to dive deeper into a topic through the system of links and hovertext.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wiktionary puts this to good use by ordering the Important Stuff on the main article page, while linking to supporting data, historical changes, usage quotations, and hiding grammatical apparatus and the like in spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atbaill&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;at-baill&lt;/a&gt; for instance, an Old Irish verb meaning to throw.

Lewis was one of the only three persons who have so far read all or a considerable pan of my 'mythology' of the First and Second Ages, which had already been in the main lines constructed before we met. He had the peculiarity that he liked to be read to. All that he knew of my 'matter' was what his capacious but not infallible memory retained from my reading to him as sole audience. His spelling &lt;em&gt;numinor&lt;/em&gt; is a hearing error, aided, no doubt, by his association of the name with Latin &lt;em&gt;nūmen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nūmina&lt;/em&gt;, and the adjective 'numinous'. Unfortunate, since the name has no such connexions, and has no reference to 'divinity' or sense of its presence. It is a construction from the Eldarin base √NDU 'below, down; descend'; Q. &lt;em&gt;núme&lt;/em&gt; 'going down, occident'; &lt;em&gt;númen&lt;/em&gt; 'the&#xA;direction or region of the sunset' +&lt;em&gt;nóre&lt;/em&gt; 'land' as an inhabited area. I have often used &lt;em&gt;Westernesse&lt;/em&gt; as a translation. This is derived from rare Middle English &lt;em&gt;Westernesse&lt;/em&gt; (known to me only in MS. C of &lt;em&gt;King Horn&lt;/em&gt;) where the meaning is vague, but may be taken to mean 'Western lands' as distinct from the East inhabited by the Paynim and Saracens. Lewis took no pan in 'research into Númenor'. N. is my personal alteration of the Atlantis myth and/or tradition, and accommodation of it to my general mythology. Of all the mythical or 'archetypal' images this is the one most deeply seated in my&#xA;imagination, and for many years I had a recurrent Atlantis dream : the stupendous and ineluctable wave advancing from the Sea or over the land, sometimes dark, sometimes green and sunlit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lewis was, I think, impressed by 'the Silmarillion and all that', and certainly retained some vague memories of it and of its names in mind. For instance, since he had heard it, before he composed or thought of &lt;em&gt;Out of the Silent Planet&lt;/em&gt;, I imagine that &lt;em&gt;Eldil&lt;/em&gt; is an echo of the &lt;em&gt;Eldar&lt;/em&gt;; in &lt;em&gt;Perelandra&lt;/em&gt; 'Tor and Tinidril' are certainly an echo, since Tuor and Idril, parents of Eärendil, are major characters in 'The Fall of Gondolin', the earliest written of the legends of the First Age. But&#xA;his own mythology (incipient and never fully realized) was quite different. It was at any rate broken to bits before it became coherent by contact with C. S. Williams and his 'Arthurian' stuff – which happened between &lt;em&gt;Perelandra&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;That Hideous Strength&lt;/em&gt;. A pity, I think. But then I was and&#xA;remain wholly unsympathetic to Williams' mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was mentioned in the 2005 paper &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/324279/The_Inklings_Connecting_the_Unconnected_Genre_intertextuality_and_intersemiosis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Inklings: Connecting the Unconnected: Genre, intertextuality and intersemiosis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; by Tommi Nieminen (Department of General Linguistics, University of Helsinki, Finland):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Tolkien and Lewis made an mutual agreement to write two science fiction stories—Tolkien of a time travel, Lewis of a space travel—, and Lewis produced the first part of the &lt;em&gt;Ransom&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Out of the Silent Planet&lt;/em&gt; (1943), it was just as much an allegory as were his previous works, or the later ones such as the &lt;em&gt;Narnia&lt;/em&gt; series (1950–56). Even the names borrowed from Tolkien to the &lt;em&gt;Ransom&lt;/em&gt; novels—taken not from Tolkien’s writings but his reading aloud &lt;em&gt;The Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; stories in the Inklings meetings—were given so different second-world interpretations that they do not carry anything of Tolkien’s world to Lewis’s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was the only confirmed use that I could identify. Others have theorized that other words were borrowed from Tolkien's conlangs, such as the name of the palace in &lt;em&gt;Narnia&lt;/em&gt;, Cair Paravel. &amp;quot;Cair&amp;quot; in Sindarin means &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot;.

Consider French: the overabundance of silent letters at the ends of words means, for example, chien (dog) and chiens (dogs) are pronounced exactly the same. The language gets around it through the articles; you know that &amp;quot;le chien&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;the (male) dog&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;les chiens&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;the (male) dogs&amp;quot;, thus in this case the difference is indicated by the difference between [lə] and [le].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in some cases, it can get ridiculous.

The only way you can differentiate them in speech is by the pronouns. Except, well, il/ils is pronounced the same, as is elle/elles.

At best, if you find a word commonly next to a picture of a tree, you could assume the word actually does mean &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot;, and try to deduce the meanings of a few other words from that? (Or, as Chadwick did with Linear B, guess that a word is the name of a city) (Or, as Champollion did with Hieroglyphics, guess that a word is the name of a ruler/pharaoh, because it's written in a special way and repeats across documents)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the positives though:&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;What might be your best bet to find out is actually the grammar of the unknown language! (Though still only in tiny bits) If your language is written in an alphabet or abjad, you got the jackpot, because then you can with super high probability (given enough material) identify common affixes in words, and likely identify different sets of words which use different kinds of affixes, which allows you to distinguish word classes. Given that verbs are usually rarer in sentences than nouns (English has a lot of helper verbs, but other languages don't necessarily), and particles are usually rather short, you can even &lt;em&gt;identify&lt;/em&gt; word classes.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;If you have a language written in a syllabary, this might well be possible as well, but will be harder. (Worse, though also better sometimes, the syllables might stretch across multiple parts of speech; see again the decipherment of Linear B, which relied critically on Alice Kober's insight that exactly this was happening, allowing her to identify syllables with common consonants/vowel contents, but afaik that only enables Chadwick's identification of some words as city names due to repeated consonants/vowels, e.g. ��� as Ko-No-So=Knossos)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all this is way way way way way WAY more complicated than this, might well not work at all, and is probably impossible if the language is polysynthetic or the script doesn't include spaces or the script is any more complex than &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;alphabet&amp;quot; or &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;syllabary&amp;quot;.

For example, during the Roman era, people all across Europe and the surrounding areas had some proficiency in Latin; people in North Africa might speak Punic as their native language, and people in Iberia might speak Iberian, but they would both know enough Latin to do business with each other. Or, think about the role of English in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These sorts of trade languages tend to come about when one group has enough social or political power that people across a wide area consider their language valuable to learn. I don't know much about Star Wars, but I can easily imagine the language of a Galactic Empire becoming one of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another meaning of the term is a language variety that arises specifically for trade. In this meaning, it's something like a creole, with features of different languages combining together as people try to figure out a way to communicate across language barriers (and then pass the language down to their children). The &amp;quot;lingua franca&amp;quot; used across the Mediterranean during the Renaissance, for example, was probably one of these; people speaking Romance, Greek, Arabic, and Turkish ended up adopting words and pieces of grammar from the other languages in order to do business and ended up with an amalgam of all four. Or for another example, Arabic-speaking traders wanted to do business with Bantu-speakers along the east coast of Africa, and the end result was Swahili.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this sort of language to arise, you need two or more groups of people with a strong need to communicate with each other, and without the sort of power differential that leads to one group's language being adopted as a default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that these two meanings aren't mutually exclusive: they're more like different points on a spectrum. When languages come into contact they always have an influence on each other; the question is how strong that influence is, and how intelligible the end result is to someone who only speaks one of the parent languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="593" LastActivityDate="2022-05-28T19:22:31.467" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
